Hello,

I bachelor'd in Computer Science and was fascinated about cybersecurity for a long time.
I worked in the field of computer security for close to 6 years, 2 as an independent student researcher and close to 4 years at Cisco Systems as a software engineer in one of Cisco's Router Security team.
I worked on a range of subjects - starting from hardware/firmware security to OS security to network and infrastructure security. I started by understanding how code translates to 0s and 1s, the x86 assembly language to designing and working on software solutions that improved the overall security posture of critical infrastructure (the Internet, data-centers, enterprise networks).

2. RE, BE, Software Vulnerabilities: I wrote a long series of articles on software reverse engineering, software vulnerabilities and binary exploitation. You can find them [here](/reverse/engineering/and/binary/exploitation/series/2019/03/25/reverse-engineering-and-binary-exploitation-series-mainpage.html).
3. Malware Analysis, Cyber-Intelligence: I had a number of personal projects from analyzing pieces of malware(like a virus or a trojanhorse), to writing tools (based on concepts explained in various articles, research papers). You can find them [here](/2021/07/18/personal-projects.html).
4. There are some generic articles on computer systems and security [here](/2019/03/25/talks-and-workshops-mainpage.htm).
5. On Rust: The Rust Programming Language interested me a lot. I ended up writing quite a bit about the language internals, lots of code and analysis and particularly on the Event-Driven Programming paradigm. You can find them [here](/rust/2020/10/11/rust-c-experiments.html).
6. Network Packet Analysis: As a vowed network security enthusiast, I wrote an amateur network packet analysis tool understanding various network protocols (like TCP, IP, Ethernet and so on). You can find details about it [here](/packet/overflow/2019/03/25/packet-overflow-mainpage.html).
7. How do you setup a simple blog like this one in an hour? [Read this](/blogging/2019/03/25/setting-up-a-blog-using-jekyll-mainpage.html)
8. Awesome resources on cybersecurity: [link](/2025/03/12/cybersecurity-resources.html/)

At one point, I decided to pursue an MBA, so I have switched to the management stream, and have a variety of interests in IT: Information Systems, IT Strategy for Businesses, Cyber-Risk Management, Cybersecurity in Finance and E-Commerce.
Follow this space if these topics interest you.

Cheers,
