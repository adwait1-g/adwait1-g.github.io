## 1. Event-Log Datasets

To understand business processes of different industries, a lot of resources are available. But to practically apply BPM techniques and experiment, there is a need for industry-specific datasets. In that, good bit of research happens with the help of Event-Logs and logs complementing it. I scout for datasets from time to time especially if I want to dig deep into the processes of a particular industry, will be sharing the references to those datasets here.
