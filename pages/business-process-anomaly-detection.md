Business Process Anomaly Detection(BPAD) is turning out to be a really interesting topic, so decided to create a separate page for it and curate all the resources related to it here.

# 1. Books, Texts, Literature Reviews, Surveys

This is all the surveys/lit-reviews I could find on BPAD. And the latest one listed here is not available for public. I have a feeling BPAD needs a good, comprehensive literature review.

2024, Jan -- [Survey and Benchmark of Anomaly Detection in Business Processes](https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2024.3484159)     
2023, Mar -- [A Systematic Review of Anomaly Detection for Business Process Event Logs](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-023-00794-y)      
2017 -- [Systematic Literature Review on Anomaly Detection in Business Process Runtime Behavior](http://eprints-dev5.cs.univie.ac.at/5220/1/paper.pdf)      
2017 -- [Anomaly Detection in Business Process Runtime Behavior - Challenges and Limitations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06659)     
2008 -- [Anomaly Detection using Process Mining](https://www.vdaalst.com/publications/p512.pdf): by Prof. Will van der Aalst    

# 2. Papers, Research

Plan to list down good number of papers which have had significant contributions. Along with that, I am looking at modern BPAD methods that involve the use of machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, so the list will be crowded with that.
