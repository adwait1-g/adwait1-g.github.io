I got introduced to the subject of business processes through the Enterprise Systems course during my spring semester (Jan-Apr 2025). It gave me a good introduction along with a sneak peek into some of the advanced stuff that happens in this field - like process mining, tools like Celonis and so on. Fortunately, I work on business processes at my internship - which is business and customer facing, more like application of this field where we work on improving/re-engineering business processes of our clients. The other side of it is management research pertaining to business process management - which deals with fundamentals of business process analysis, theory and application of the same and so on. I plan to write about both facets here, along with listing down some good resources I come across.
