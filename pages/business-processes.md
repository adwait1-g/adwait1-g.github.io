I got introduced to the subject of business processes through the Enterprise Systems course during my spring semester. It gave me a good introduction along with a sneak peek into some of the advanced stuff that happens in this field - like process mining, tools like Celonis and so on. Fortunately, I work on business processes at my internship - which is business and customer facing, more like application of this field where we work on improving/re-engineering business processes of our clients. The other side of it is management research pertaining to business processes - which deals with fundamentals of business process analysis, theory and application of process mining and so on. I plan to write about both facets here, along with listing down some good resources I come across.

## 1. Business Process Management

1. [Handbook on Business Process Management: Introduction, Methods and Information Systems](http://repo.darmajaya.ac.id/5380/1/Handbook%20on%20Business%20Process%20Management%201_%20Introduction%2C%20Methods%2C%20and%20Information%20Systems%20%28%20PDFDrive%20%29.pdf)    
2. [Fundamentals of Business Process Management](https://repository.dinus.ac.id/docs/ajar/Fundamentals_of_Business_Process_Management_1.pdf)   

## 2. Process Mining

1. [Process Mining Handbook](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/id/e9c5f431-eb92-45dc-a4ab-3f7ecbf91426/978-3-031-08848-3.pdf): By Prof. Will van der Aalst   
2. [Prof. Will van der Aalst's Website](https://www.vdaalst.com/)   
3. [Process Mining: Data Science in Action](http://repo.darmajaya.ac.id/4319/1/Process%2520Mining_%2520Data%2520Science%2520in%2520Action%2520%2528%2520PDFDrive%2520%2529.pdf)

### 2.1 Process Discovery

1. [Foundations of Process Discovery](https://www.vdaalst.rwth-aachen.de/publications/p1330.pdf) by Prof. Will van der Aalst   

### 2.2 Process Mining and Deep Learning

The above sets the foundation of Process Mining, but this is an area of interest for me. It is more or less a new area looking at the amount of research present on it.
