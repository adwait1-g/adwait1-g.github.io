Hallo!

I am Adwaith. I am a business student at the ESCP Business School, Europe. I am part of the PGDM-IB programme at the Management Development Institute, Gurgaon, India. At the moment, a few fields that interest me are Operations Management, Logistics, Supply Chain Management, Aviation & Airport Management and Finance. I am interested/intend to understand and solve interesting business problems in these fields using Operations Research, Quantitative Methods, Machine Learning.

Previously, I worked at Cisco Systems Bangalore as a software engineer for about 4 years. I was part of Cisco's MIG (Mass-Scale Infrastructure Group) security team. It was a router security team for the MIG vertical which sold carrier grade routers (routers for service-providers like Airtel, Jio, AT&T, Verizon etc., and data-center customers like Google, Facebook, Amazon etc.,). I graduated with a Bachelor in Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, batch of 2020.

Back then, I was absolutely fascinated with Computer Systems and Security. I spent a solid 6 years of my life in that field, 2 as a student exploring the field, building a good community around it at my college, and 4 years working in the industry as a software engineer working on core network security protocols and more. I have blogged on various subjects in Computer Security extensively back in the day, you can find them [here](/archive/), in case you are interested.

So why MBA?

I am probably writing this more to make myself understand why I decided to pursue a management degree than to convey others about it.

At some point, I started to feel I wanted a change and that started to get reflected in my work. That is not a good state to be in - both for myself and for the company I worked for. After some thinking, I decided to pursue an MBA purely because I wanted to try out something totally new, I wanted a little stress, less responsibilities atleast for a while. Although going back as a student seemed a bit daunting, I wanted to do it.

Fast forward, I joined the dual degree PGDM-IB programme at the Management Development Institute in Gurgaon In June 2024. Luckily, I found most of what I learnt very interesting. The curriculum was Finance heavy along with quite a bit of mathematics like business statistics. I ended up liking a bunch of "theory" subjects too like Organization, Strategy and so on. I found Logistics, Operations Management, Supply Chain Management and Finance most interesting.

As of January 2025, I am at the ESCP Business School, Europe for my exchange year. Here, I am specializing in AI and Big Data for Business Innovation. In short, this specialization is about using AI and Big Data Analytics to solve business/management problems. I will be learning a little bit of math, good amount of programming and most of all, applying them to solve interesting business problems - like how do you have optimal inventory, can you get an accurate forecast on the next year's customer demand, or can you optimize that supply chain and cut your costs and so on. I am personally interested in both the mathematics of it and its usage to solve business problems. Starting from using simple linear programming to planning the inventory to using some kind of regression to forecast the customer demand to using certain machine learning technique to optimize your supply chain - I find both parts interesting.

I came across a quirky quote a couple of months ago - "If you want to become a millionaire, take a billion dollars and start an airline". That forced me to take a look at the aviation industry and it actually fascinated me quite a bit - almost all facets of it - from the type of airplanes these airlines companies use to scheduling airlines for various routes to revenue management to other daily/tactical operations. I got a vague idea about the validity of that quote but now I can't stop, I want to delve deeper. So in my free time, I spend my time reading and modeling problems in the aviation and airport industry.

Even though I don't have an answer to why I took management, I find what I am learning and doing right now interesting, so I will go with that. What is more odd (in a positive way) is how I was so fixated on cybersecurity at one point in my life to doing something totally unrelated and still find as much happiness in it.

This blog was dead. The last time I wrote something of meaning here was sometime in 2021 or early 2022 I believe. After 3+ years, I am revamping this blog and want to do something with this yet again. I can say almost have the same excitment I have when I started this blog in my second year of engineering, when I was so eager to write and document what I had learnt, the papers I read, the experiments I did and so on. Although this time I will probably be writing about management problems, some might involve math-programming, some just simple reasoning. Lets see how it goes!

Cheers!
Adwaith
