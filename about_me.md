Hallo!

I am Adwaith. I am a business student at the [ESCP Business School](https://escp.eu/programmes/master-in-management), Europe. I am part of the [PGDM-IB](https://www.mdi.ac.in/programmes/post-graduate-diploma-in-management-international-business-pgdm-ib) programme at the [Management Development Institute, Gurgaon](https://www.mdi.ac.in/), India. I recently finished my spring semester at ESCP's Berlin campus and currently spending the summer interning as an Analyst at a Business consulting startup.

Previously, I worked at Cisco Systems Bangalore as a software engineer for about 4 years. I was part of Cisco's MIG (Mass-Scale Infrastructure Group) security team. It was a router security team for the MIG vertical which sold carrier grade routers (routers for service-providers like Airtel, Jio, AT&T, Verizon etc., and data-center customers like Google, Facebook, Amazon etc.,). I graduated with a Bachelor in Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, batch of 2020.

Back then, I was absolutely fascinated with Computer Systems and Security. I spent a solid 6 years of my life in that field, 2 as a student exploring the field, building a good community around it at my college, and 4 years working in the industry as a software engineer working on core network security protocols and more. I have blogged on various subjects in Computer Security extensively back in the day, you can find them [here](/archive/), in case you are interested.

Fast forward to June 2024, I joined the dual degree PGDM-IB programme at the Management Development Institute in Gurgaon In June 2024. Luckily, I found most of what I learnt very interesting. The curriculum was Finance heavy along with quite a bit of mathematics like business statistics. I ended up liking a bunch of "theory" subjects too like Organization, Strategy and so on. I found Logistics, Operations Management, Supply Chain Management and Finance most interesting.

As of January 2025, I am at the ESCP Business School, Europe for my MiM year. Here at the Berlin campus, I am specializing in [AI and Big Data for Business Innovation](https://ent.escpeurope.eu/Syllabus/SylView/view/11760857/2). It is a techno-managerial [specialization](/mdi/2025/03/01/ai-and-big-data-for-biz-innovation.html) which uses technology to solve interesting business problems.

For some time, I am interested in AI, ML and using it to solve business problems, which is also why I took up the said specialization. I intend to write about this in the near future.

This blog was dead for quite some time. The last time I wrote something of meaning here was sometime in late 2021 I believe. After close to 4 years, I am revamping this blog and want to do something with this yet again. I plan to do what I did back then - read interesting articles and research papers, business cases and write about them, write summaries, perform experiments and learning I will take part in.

Cheers!
