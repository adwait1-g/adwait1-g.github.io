Hallo!

I am Adwaith. I am a business student at the ESCP Business School, Europe. I am part of the PGDM-IB programme at the Management Development Institute, Gurgaon, India. At the moment, a few fields that interest me are Operations Management, Logistics, Supply Chain Management, Aviation & Airport Management and Finance. I am interested/intend to understand and solve interesting business problems in these fields using Operations Research, Quantitative Methods, Machine Learning.

Previously, I worked at Cisco Systems Bangalore as a software engineer for about 4 years. I was part of Cisco's MIG (Mass-Scale Infrastructure Group) security team. It was a router security team for the MIG vertical which sold carrier grade routers (routers for service-providers like Airtel, Jio, AT&T, Verizon etc., and data-center customers like Google, Facebook, Amazon etc.,). I graduated with a Bachelor in Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, batch of 2020.

Back then, I was absolutely fascinated with Computer Systems and Security. I spent a solid 6 years of my life in that field, 2 as a student exploring the field, building a good community around it at my college, and 4 years working in the industry as a software engineer working on core network security protocols and more. I have blogged on various subjects in Computer Security extensively back in the day, you can find them [here](/archive/), in case you are interested.

Fast forward to June 2024, I joined the dual degree PGDM-IB programme at the Management Development Institute in Gurgaon In June 2024. Luckily, I found most of what I learnt very interesting. The curriculum was Finance heavy along with quite a bit of mathematics like business statistics. I ended up liking a bunch of "theory" subjects too like Organization, Strategy and so on. I found Logistics, Operations Management, Supply Chain Management and Finance most interesting.

As of January 2025, I am at the ESCP Business School, Europe for my MiM year. Here, I am specializing in AI and Big Data for Business Innovation. In short, this specialization is about using AI and Big Data Analytics to solve business/management problems. I will be learning a quite a bit of math, good amount of programming and most of all, applying them to solve interesting business problems - like how do you have optimal inventory, can you get an accurate forecast on the next year's customer demand, or can you optimize that supply chain and cut your costs and so on. I am interested in both facets of it - the foundational mathematics involved in analytics and its usage on business problems.

Apart from my primary interests, I have been into aviation management and analytics for a while now - the reason being how uncertain and complex the environment is for that industry. I find every function of the aviation industry fasinating - the route scheduling to fuel planning to revenue management, crew management and so on. In my free time, I spend time on reading and mathematically modeling problems pertinent to this industry.

Well, this blog was dead for a while now. The last time I wrote something of meaning here was sometime in 2021 or early 2022 I believe. After 3+ years, I am revamping this blog and want to do something with this yet again. I plan to do what I did back then - read interesting articles and research papers, business cases and write about them, write summaries, implementations and other experiments and learning I will take part in.

Cheers!
