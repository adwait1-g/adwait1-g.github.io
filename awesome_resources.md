## 0. Transportation Networks, Optimization, Graph Theory

Off-late (10 March 2025), I have been reading about and working on the concept of Physical Internet. It is an alternate paradigm of logistics network inspired from the Digital Internet.

## 1. Aviation Management and Airport Operations

This is one field that I find absolutely fascinating these days. In its operations (be it an airline or an airport), it has every type of management problem and I think each facet of its operations is its own field of research.

# 1.1 Books

1. [Airline Operations and Management: A Management Textbook](https://archive.org/details/airline-operations-and-management-a-management-textbook-pdfdrive_202105): A great book that introduces the subject of Airline Management (only tactical management, not strategic) from a managerial perspective. It is heavy on concepts and jargon, a great introductory book. The manager in me got very excited reading this book. The latest edition of this book is available on libgen.
2. [Airline Operations and Scheduling](https://ftp.idu.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/ebook/ip/BUKU%20SCHEDULING/Airline%20Operations%20and%20Scheduling.pdf): A great book if one wants to dive into the world of modeling various aviation management problems, solve them using excel and get a taste of application of operations research in aviation. The author makes it clear that the book is a bridge between the theory and the actual mathematical research that happens on aviation (which is highly technical and regular management students may miss out on it). The Author, [Prof. Massoud Bazargan](https://faculty.erau.edu/Massoud.Bazargan) is an expert in the field, he is broadly into Operations Research and Decision Sciences and using them to solve problems in various fields, looking at his page. Give it a try if you want to get a glimpse of how things are modeled and how things are made to work.
3. [Airport Operations, by Norman Ashford](http://repo.poltekbangsby.ac.id/id/eprint/581/1/Airport%20Operations,%203%20edition%20(%20PDFDrive%20).pdf): I have read parts of the book necessary for my research (chapters on Passenger Flows, Cargo Operations and Airline Scheduling to be precise), I found it to more than an introductory book.
4. [The Global Airline Industry, by Prof. Peter Belobaba](http://komaristaya.ru/stud/the.global.airline.industry.pdf)
5. [Airport Engineering: Planning, Design, and Development of 21st century airports, by Norman J. Ashford](http://books.ms/main/4917C01E21090B239567A7EC91348B4B)

# 1.2 Research Papers

1. [A Survey on Reinforcement Learning in Aviation Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02147): November 2022.

# 1.3 Interesting Links

1. [AGIFORS](https://agifors.org/): A crazy society of people who are into Operations Research and the Aviation Industry. The society has researchers from all over the world, universities and industry, and has produced ground-breaking research. One may join it as a Correspondent (it is free of cost) and can get access to all the great work they do.
2. [Airline Management: MIT OCW Course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/16-75j-airline-management-spring-2006/): A neat course on Airline Management by Prof. Peter Belobaba. I refered to parts of the courses while reading the above books, found it useful at places. Covers all aspects of Airline Management, but has concise slides and a few readings. I think one can gain more from this course if pursued along with reading the book written by Prof. Belobaba (The Global Airline Industry).
3. [INFORMS](https://www.informs.org/): Well, INFORMS is a society by researchers into Operations Research and Decision Sciences. From what I have seen, the Transportation Science part of it has a lot of stuff on Aviation (mostly route scheduling and so on).

## 2. Logistics and Supply Chain Management

# 2.1 Books

1. [Operations Management, by Russel and Taylor](http://jtelen.free.fr/0MARINE%20bouquins/%5BRoberta_S._Russell,_Bernard_W._Taylor%5D_Operations(Bookos.org).pdf): My first book on Operations Management, an excellent introductory book. Gives a taste of the various facets of Operations (Inventory, Facility Location, Facility Design, Resource Planning, Supply Chain Management and so on).
2. [Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning and Operation by Chopra and Meindl](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abdelkader-Bouaziz/post/Can_I_request_if_someone_can_help_me_with_pearson_instructor_manual_for_Supply_chain_management_strategy_planning_and_operation_2016/attachment/5f09e009ceab7c0001366546/AS%253A912140693143553%25401594482696611/download/Supply%2BChain%2BManagement%2BStrategy%252C%2BPlanning%252C%2Band%2BOperation.pdf): A detailed introduction to Supply Chain management and logistics. This is the book my Operations professor recommended when I asked him what I had to do in order to deep dive.
3. [DHL: From Startup to Global Upstart](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/DHL-Startup-Upstart-Po-Chung/dp/1501515926): DHL is a well-known logistics company and this book is about its story. DHL is a California based start-up which is acquired by Deutsche Post in the early 2000s, then it goes on to become the world leader in logistics service. Its not really a technical book, but if one is fascinated by Logistics, they might end up liking it. Book is available on libgen.

## 3. Operations Research, Decision Sciences, Quantitative Methods

When it comes to OR/DS/QM, you can say I am a wanna-be. The stuff I had learnt (Graph Theory, Optimization, Transportation problems etc.,) are all very pertinent to the field but its all very rusty in my mind given it was a while ago I studied them. And today AI-ML is also included here which I have no clue about. So I plan to brush up on the old stuff I had learnt and learn atleast the simple stuff in AI-ML. Partly why I took up a Big Data Analytics specialization.

# 3.1 Books

1. [Introduction to Operations Research, by Hillier and Lieberman](https://archive.org/details/introduction-to-operations-research): The go-to book management students refer to when they want to get a taste of Operations Research. One tip if you plan to read it: I tried to read it the traditional way - where I start from page 1 and wanted to go till the end. It wasn't really a good idea. In this book, each chapter is a huge topic in itself. For example, just reading the chapter of Queuing Theory was not pleasurous. I generally used to explore various industries which will incorporate one or more of these concepts in it, and then I would read just the relevant chapter - I started using it as a reference book than a course textbook. For example, one big part of aviation is route scheduling and to get a good understanding of it, I had to get hold of the transportation problems, network optimization - so I read these chapters, to understand Passenger Flows in Airport Operations, knowing queuing theory was necessary, so I ended up reading it. You might be able to read the book in one go, but in case you are not able to, try out this method.
2. [Introduction to Management Science: A modeling and case studies approach with spreadsheets, by Hillier and Hillier](https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780070599680): A book written by the Hillier Father-Son duo. Same with the previous book, I did not "finish" this book in one go. Just read the concepts and did the excel problems when I encountered the relevant concept. A great book if you want to focus mainly on modeling problems and solving them on Excel (than get into the crazy mathematics behind it).
3. [Introduction to Queuing Theory, by Robert Cooper](https://www.cse.fau.edu/~bob/publications/IntroToQueueingTheory_Cooper.pdf)
4. [Basic Queuing Theory](https://yzr95924.github.io/pdf/book/Basic-Queueing-Theory.pdf)
5. [Machine Learning - A Probabilistic Perspective, by Kevin P. Murphy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerasking/book-1/master/ML%20Machine%20Learning-A%20Probabilistic%20Perspective.pdf): A book my professor suggested for better understanding ML
6. [Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning, by Miguel Morales](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-reinforcement-learning): Honestly the only book in this section I have braved to open and understand first few chapters well. Even though I don't have a mathematical understanding of (D)RL as of now, I have a hunch that it is well-suited for many problems in Supply Chain Management and overall the field of Operations in general. Which is why I want to get my understanding right when it comes to (D)RL. Book available on libgen.
