Hello fellow pwners!

Let us continue our journey in Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation. So far, we have seen how an executable is generated, it's internal structure and x86 assembly. In this post, let us see how a program looks like when it is being executed.

This is the 4th post in this series. So, create a directory **post_4** in the **rev_eng_series** directory and store all the work done in this directory.

## 1\. What all does a program have?

Consider this program **code1.c** .

    #include<stdio.h>
    #include<stdlib.h>
    
    int gv1;
    int gv2 = 123;
    
    void func1();
    
    int main() {
    
        int lv = 222, *dyn;
    
        dyn = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    
        printf("Address of lv, a local variable = %p\n", &lv);
        printf("Value of dyn(dynamically allocated memory) = %p\n", dyn);
        printf("Address of gv1, an uninitialized global variable = %p\n", &gv1);
        printf("Address of gv2, an initialized global variable = %p\n", &gv2);
        printf("Address of func1 = %p\n", func1);
        printf("Address of main = %p\n", main);
    
        printf("\nPID = %d\n", getpid());
    
        func1();
    
        while(1);
    
        return 0;
    }
    
    void func1() {
    
        int lv2 = 999;
        printf("Address of lv2, a local variable of func1 = %p\n", &lv2);
        return; 
    }
    

a. In general, a program can have these elements:

*   **Global Variables** - gv1 and gv2 
*   **Functions** - main and func1
*   Every function will have it's own set of **private / local variables** - lv1 for main and lv2 in func1
*   Might have **dynamically allocated** variables - dyn
*   Functions from external / Shared Libraries - printf(), getpid()

b. Every element in the above list is stored in a particular location based on what they are. Eg: Machine code is stored in a particular memory location. Global Variables are stored in a different memory location. In this article, we will see how a program's memory is divided into different locations where all these elements are stored.

## 2\. Program Vs Process

Sometimes, we use the words **Program** and **Process** interchangbly but they definitely not the same. It is important to understand the difference.

*   A Program is typically an executable stored in the Hard-Disk. It is an ELF File with segments, sections, headers etc.,

*   When you run a program, you **spawn** a process. You can think of a process as a **Program under Execution** . A process **lives** in the main memory, but a program just **exists dead** in Hard Disk.

*   A process lives because it is being executed, every instruction in it is being executed, every variable is allocated some memory, values are changing, functions are being called etc., There is so much happening when a program is executed, but a program by itself is just a file sitting in the Hard-Disk waiting to be executed.

## 3\. How does a process look like in memory?

We said that a process is program under execution. We have seem how a program looks like. It has ELF Header, Program Header Table, Section Header table, Segments, sections etc.,

The Program Headers will decide the Memory Layout of a process.

Now, let us look at the process. This is rough **Memory Layout** of any process. This is how a process lives in Main Memory.

![memory_layout](/assets/2018-08-18-memory-layout-of-a-process/memory_layout.jpeg)

Let us start discussing from bottom to top of that image.

a. **Text Section** : This section has pure machine code in it. It contains all the functions we would have written in the program in binary form. Note that starts from the **Lowest Address** .

b. **Data section** : This section is where **Global Initialized Variables** are stored. It is right above the Text section.

c. **BSS section** : BSS section contains all **Global Uninitialized Variables**. As far as I know, BSS is know as **Better Save Space** because in the object file, it does not take any space except the name and size of the variable. It is given actual memory only when the program is executed - BSS variables come alive :P

d. **Heap** : First thing I want to clarify is that this Heap has no relation with the **Heap Data Structure** . This **Heap** refers to a **Heap of Memory** like **Heap of Clothes** . Just a huge pile of memory which we can allocate for our variables and use at runtime.

*   If memory is allocated dynamically at runtime, then that memory belongs to **Heap** . **malloc()** , **calloc()** functions in C and **new** function in C++ allocate memory from heap. 

Eg: In code1.c program, **dyn** is a pointer to an integer. **malloc()** takes in an arguments of size of memory we want and returns a pointer to that memory. This memory is taken from Heap. You will understand this clearly when we go through the example.

*   Observe the arrow mark from Heap pointing upwards. Let us take an example to understand what this pointing upwards means. Consider this program **code2.c** .
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_4$ cat code2.c
        #include<stdio.h>
        #include<stdlib.h>
        
        int main() {
        
        int *ptr, i = 0;
        
        while(i < 1000) {
            ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
            printf("%p\n", ptr);
            i++;
        }
        
        return 0;
        } 
        

*   It is a pretty straight forward program. It allocates memory using malloc and stores that Address return by malloc in **ptr**. The value of **ptr** is printed. So, we are printing the address of that memory chunk allocated by malloc. The same process is being repeated for 1000 times.

*   Point of this program is, more and more memory is allocated by malloc. Look at the following output.
    
        ----------
        ----------
        0x1a05f00
        0x1a05f20
        0x1a05f40
        0x1a05f60
        0x1a05f80
        0x1a05fa0
        0x1a05fc0
        0x1a05fe0
        0x1a06000
        0x1a06020
        0x1a06040
        0x1a06060
        0x1a06080
        0x1a060a0
        0x1a060c0
        0x1a060e0
        0x1a06100
        ---------
        ---------
        

*   Observe the addresses. The Address Value is increasing for every new malloc you do. So, when you allocate more and more memory, memory of higher addresses get allocated. Refer to that diagram of ours. The Top of the Diagram denoted High addresses and this arrow was pointing upwards. In other words, Heap grows upwards.

*   As an experiment, in code2.c , remove that condition **i < 1000** and replace it with an infinite loop and see what happens.

e. **Shared Libraries** : The most commonly used Shared Library by a C program is the **libc** . C++ programs use **libc++** .

f. **Stack** : This part of process memory is used to store **Local Variables** of a function. Stack is the **Back-Bone** of any program because **Control Flow** (Function Call and Return) is maintained with the help of the stack. We will see how exactly Stack behaves as a back-bone of a program in upcoming posts.

*   Note that Stack grows downwards. That is, It starts with Higher Addresses and continues to grow towards lower addresses - just opposite of Heap. 

Now that theory is done, let us dive into practicals part and experiment with what all we have discussed so far.

## 4\. Practicals

Consider **code1.c** . Compile it and get a program named **code1** program.

a. This is the output of **code1** is something like this.

    ~/rev_eng_series/post_4$ ./code1
    Address of lv, a local variable = 0x7ffef69b45dc
    Value of dyn(dynamically allocated memory) = 0x1e91010
    Address of gv1, an uninitialized global variable = 0x601058
    Address of gv2, an initialized global variable = 0x601050
    Address of func1 = 0x4006f5
    Address of main = 0x400626
    
    PID = 5667
    Address of lv2, a local variable of func1 = 0x7ffef69b45b4
    

b. Compare the Output of the code1.c with the diagram which we discussed earlier. Compare the Addresses of every segment. It should perfectly match what we have discussed.

*   Address of lv(Local variable - Stack) > Value of dyn(Dynamically allocated - Heap) > Address of gv1(Uninitialized variable - BSS) > Address of gv2(Initialized variable - Data Section) > Address of main(Machine code - Text Section)

**NOTE :** The program comes to a still state because of that **while(1)** . This Infinite Loop is put just to keep the process alive in the main memory and we can do our analysis with ease. Open up a new terminal for further analysis.

*   In an Operating System, there can be hundreds of processes running. There should be some method to identify a process in a unique manner(like the way you have your Social Security Number or Aadhar Number in India) . The OS assigns a **Process ID** to every process. As our **code1** is still running, we can get it's **Process ID / PID** .

*   The PID = **5667** . I have put a printf() statement in **code1.c** which prints the PID just to make our analysis easy. Another way to get PID of a process is to use **ps** command.

*   Once we have the PID of any process, the best way to learn about that particular process is to go to the **/proc** directory. **proc** is short form for **process**. This has details of every process running in the OS. Let's go to that directory.

        /proc/5667$ 
        

*   It has a lot of information about the process. As we are discussing about the memory layout of the process, we will look into a memory-related of files present here.

*   First, let us look into the **map_files** directory.

        /proc/5667/map_files$ 
        
    
    *   This directory has a list of all the files(in the Hard-Disk) which are mapped into the main memory. Mapping simply means that copying the file on a Hard-Disk to Main Memory. This mapping is done by a function called **mmap** . To learn more about mmap, refer to it's manual page.
    
    *   You can see that there are 10 entries here. The first 3 Entries are mappings of **code1** / executable.
    
    *   The next 4 entries are mapping of something called **libc-2.23.so** . **libc** is the name given to the **Standard C Library** . **2\.23** is the version number. **so** stands for Shared Object. This Shared Object is an Object file with all the C Library Functions in a compiled form. It has all our printf(), scanf(), fopen(), fclose() etc., in machine code form. As our program is using C library functions, it is mapped to the process's memory. To know more about libc, refer it's manpage.
    
    *   The next 3 entries are mapping of **ld-2.23.so** .This is the ELF Dynamic Linker. This program will find, load / copy the shared libraries used by the executable onto it's memory. As our program is using C library functions, it is **ld-2.23.so**'s responsibility to copy **libc-2.23.so** onto main memory.
    
    *   Here, those **0x400000 - 0x401000** , **7f4e21d90000-7f4e21d91000** etc., are all address spaces. These address spaces are **range** of Addresses used to store something related to the process.
    
    *   One question should arise here. Why is the **code1** mapped 3 times in 3 different address spaces? or **libc-2.23.so** mapped into 4 address spaces? Let us dig more to understand this.

*   Let us see the **maps** file.

*   Entry 1:
    
    *   Address space : **0x400000 - 0x401000** 
    *   The Text Section of a program is mapped onto this address space.The Text Segment contains Header details and the C program we wrote in form of machine language. 
    *   Second column is **r-xp** . **r** stands for Read Permission, **w** stands for **Write Permission** and **x** stands for **Executable** Permission. This Address space has Read and Executable Permissions. It means, it can be read and it can be executed also. Generally, any segment which has Executable Permissions will also have Read Permissions because you have to read and process the segment to execute code in it.

*   Entry 2:
    
    *   Address space : **0x600000 - 0x601000** 
    *   The **read-only** section is mapped onto this address space. This Section consists of Hard-coded strings etc., It's permissions is **r--p** as expected.

*   Entry 3:
    
    *   Address space : **0x601000 - 0x602000** 
    *   This is the Data Section. It has all the global variables in it. Check out the addresses of **gv1** and **gv2** of **code1** . 
    *   It's permissions is **rw-p** .

*   The point to understand is, all these 3 sections belong to the same file - **/rev_eng_series/post_4/code1** . So, the same file is **not** being mapped thrice, but 3 different sections(Text, Read-Only, Data) of the **same** executable file are mapped to 3 different address spaces.

*   Entry 4:
    
    *   Address space : **01e91000-01eb2000**
    *   This is the **heap** . This whole Address space is given to this process and the process can use it whenever it wants. Check out the value of **dyn** . Whenever the process wants memory at runtime(Dynamic allocation), a piece of memory of requested size is given to the process. 
    *   It's permissions is **rw-p** .

*   Entry 5, 6, 7 & 8:
    
    *   There are 4 Address spaces. 
    *   Notice that each Address space has a different set of permissions. This means the Shared Library **libc-2.23.so** has segments of those permissions. Each of those segments is mapped in a different Address space.

*   Entry 10, 12 & 13:
    
    *   There are 3 Address spaces. 
    *   **ld-2.23.so** has 3 parts with different permissions. So, each part is mapped into a different address space.

*   Entry 14:
    
    *   Address space: 7f4e21d91000-7f4e21d92000
    *   This is the **stack** Address space. This is the place where all the local variables, arguments to functions, control information are stored. 
    *   It's permissions are **rw-p** .

*   Entry 15, 16 and 17 require a bit of Operating System Internals which we have not discussed as of now. We will probably discuss in later posts, but will discuss it for sure!

*   We just had a look at how a process looks like in memory. There are different address spaces, each address space serving a particular purpose.

With this, I hope you have understood how a program looks like in memory when it is being executed.

## 5\. A few more important things!

a. Why does the heap grow upward and stack downward?

*   There is no rule that heap should grow upward and stack downward. The growth of heap and stack depends on the **processor** . We are using **x86** where stack is designed to grow down.

*   There are architectures like **SPARC** , **ARM**(Famous mobile-phone architecture) where the growth direction can be chosen. So, stack can either grow down or up.

*   This stackoverflow answer should give you more insight: [Link][1]

b. Do we always need to map shared libraries?

*   Library functions like printf(), scanf() etc., are present in **libc-2.23.so** . When they are called, the **Dynamic Linker** - **ld-2.23.so** gives an address to the Library function called(Dynamically Links it) and after the function is given an address, it works like any other normal function.

*   The C / C++ programs we compile are **Dynamically Linked** by default. That is, the functions they use (say printf) are given addresses when it is called and then it is executed.

*   If shared libraries are not mapped onto the process's memory, we cannot use the library functions **if** the programs are **dynamically linked** .

*   We can also do this. Suppose an executable is using printf. I can copy the complete sourcecode of printf into my executable. Now, even if I don't map libc, I will be able to run printf because it is present in my executable itself.

*   In general, suppose a program uses 10 C library functions. Copy sourcecode of all those 10 library functions from libc into the executable while compiling. So, I can run the executable independent of libc.

*   This concept of copying sourcecode of functions being used by a program into it's executable is known as **Static Linking** .

*   The sourcecode mentioned above refers to machine code of those functions.

*   Let us take an example to understand this better. Consider a simple **hello.c** .
    
        #include<stdio.h>
        int main() {
            printf("Hello world!\n");
            return 0;
        }
        
    
    *   This program uses 1 C Library function - **printf()** . 
    *   Let us compile it in the following manners.
        
            ~/rev_eng_series/post_4$ gcc hello.c -o hello_dynamic 
            ~/rev_eng_series/post_4$ gcc hello.c -o hello_static --static
            
    
    *   The first line, you get **hello_dynamic** which is a dynamically linked executable - It does not have the sourcecode of printf() in it. It just has information which will help in dynamic linking.
    
    *   The second will result in **hello_static** . This will have the whole sourcecode of printf() .
    
    *   Check this out:
        
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_4$ ls -l hello_dynamic hello_static -rwxrwxr-x 1 adwi adwi 8600 Aug 18 22:22 hello_dynamic -rwxrwxr-x 1 adwi adwi 912664 Aug 18 22:22 hello_static ~/rev_eng_series/post_4$
    
    *   Just observe the size difference. I hope you are able to catch the point.
    
    *   Let us use the **file** command and analyze these.
        
            ~/rev_eng_series/post_4$ file hello_dynamic hello_dynamic: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=0d3706238a91f3ab4323e48c5a2971f5950aa7a3, not stripped 
            ~/rev_eng_series/post_4$ file hello_static hello_static: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=d8e808a57289057b01ffd14f67cb8cc887b0e615, not stripped ~/rev_eng_series/post_4$
            
    
    *   The point of focus is that hello_dynamic is **dynamically linked** and it has **interpreter = /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2** .
    
    *   On the other hand, hello_static is **statically linked** and does not have the dynamic linker specified because it does not need one.

*   Statically Linked executables are **Independent executables** . They have no dependencies. They can run on a machine which does not have libc in it.

*   This [article][2] should give you more insight on when to use dynamic linking and when to use static linking.

c. Why are there different permissions for different address spaces? Can't all have a simple **rwxp** rather than each one having a different one?

*   There is a long history behind this. And when it comes to permissions or allowing/disallowing someone to do something security comes into picture.

*   In late 1990s, there was a lot software being written and used. Then, permissions were not this strict. All address spaces were **rwx** . That is, every address space could be read, executed and written into.

*   Bad Guys started finding bugs / security holes in programs. There were holes which allowed them to execute whatever they wanted. They could **inject / write** code into the stack and **execute** it. If they are able to execute anything, they could bring the huge servers down, all user machines to crash or install Malicious Software like viruses, worms, trojans onto machines.

*   That's when it struck that we need to have a strong control on what address space is being used for. Not all address spaces should be executable and writable.

*   So, Stack and Heap - Wherever data is stored, these were made **rw-p** . So, even if a bad guy is able to write code into stack / heap, he/she cannot execute it simply your OS doesn't let you to.

*   In a similar manner, all executable address spaces were made **r-xp** . The Write permission was removed to make sure no bad guy should be able to change the sourcecode of a running program.

*   Notice that, If you able to write into an address space, you are not able to execute it or if you are executing instructions in that address space, you cannot write into it. It is either **Write** or **Execute** but **never** both for an address space. This Security Technique came to be known as **W^X** / **Write XOR Execute** .

*   It became a very successful security technique that it was implemented at the hardware level in all major processors like **Intel**, **AMD** .It is one bit of information. Intel guys called it **WriteDisabled** / **WD** bit. If this bit is set to 1, then you cannot write into it. **AMD** guys called it **NoExecute** / **NX** bit. If this bit is set to 0, you cannot write into it, you can execute it. Microsoft called it **Data Execution Prevention** .

*   In later posts, we will talk about what exactly those security holes are, how a bad guy can execute whatever he wants, how we can mitigate them, how to break W^X Security Technique and more.

d. To know more about **/proc** , best place is to visit it's man page.

With this, I will end this post. I hope you learned something out of this post. 

Thank you!
