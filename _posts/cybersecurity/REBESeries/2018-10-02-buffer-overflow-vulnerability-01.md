Hey fellow pwners!

In the previous article, we discussed about function calling mechanisms in 32-bit and 64-bit Intel/AMD Systems. I hope you have understood those concepts properly because they are the foundations for this and many future posts.

In this article, we will look into one of the most infamous security vulnerabilities of all time, the amazing **Buffer Overflow Vulnerability(BOF)**.You can think of this article as the beginning of a new sub-series because there are a lot of things to be discussed about BOF.

This is post number 7. So, create a directory with name **post_7** in **rev_eng_series** directory.

Let us start!

# Introduction

Before getting into details of BOF is, let us understand what a Security Vulnerability is, why is it caused, what are the problems of having such vulnerabilities in our systems.

### Vulnerability

A Vulnerability is flaw in the code or design of the software. If you are able to do something the software is not intended to do, then that's definitely a vulnerability. Let us take a small example to understand this better.

Consider a web server running on a machine. It is a process whose job is to serve specific webpages to clients who ask for it. Suppose a client finds a vulnerability in the web-server program and he does something that triggers the web-server process to crash and die, then that is unintended behavior. Crashing is not what we wanted out of that web-server. In this example, it is crashing. It could be any other behavior also.

### Exploit

In the above example, we mentioned that the client does **something** to trigger the unintended behavior. That something is known as exploit. You **exploit** a vulnerability to **enable** the unintended behavior.

### Why do vulnerabilities pop up?

**a**. Bad coding practices

**b**. Using unsecure API without knowledge of why they are unsecure and the problems behind it.

**c.** User Input plays a very key role here. In most cases, the way a person can trigger the vulnerability to make the software behave crazily is to give a **crafted** input to the software. Most software will have inputs from otuside. The input for PDF Readers is **pdf** files, the input for VLC Media player is a **media** file, for a server the input is the request from the client etc., If the input given from **outside environment** should ideally be processed, made sure it is clean and then pass it to the system. But many a times, this cleanliness check doesn't happen. The user input is **directly** passed to the system. If the user is the bad guy, then we know what to wait for if the software has vulnerabilities. This concept of checking the the user input before passing it to the system is known as **Sanity Check** . Sanity is a fancy word for clean / proper.

Now, we just know the theory related to concepts like Vulnerability, Exploit, Reasons behind why vulnerabilities exist . Let us look at all these concepts using the Buffer Overflow Vulnerability. This way, we understand these concepts and understand BOF.

This article will have a lot of examples. The whole idea is to understand the above concepts well and understand BOF.

# Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Let us understand the name first. We know what a vulnerability is now. Let us understand what a Buffer Overflow is. For that,we will take the following simple example.

## Program1

    ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ cat code1.c
    #include<stdio.h>
    #include<string.h>
    
    int main() {
    
            char buffer[10];
            scanf("%s", buffer);
            printf("buffer = %s, len(buffer) = %lu\n", buffer, strlen(buffer));
    
            return 0;
    }
    

### Overview

1.  It is a simple program. 
2.  There is a **buffer** of size **10** bytes. 
3.  We are using **scanf** to take user input and storing that user input into that buffer. 
4.  The printf() statement prints the buffer contents and length of data stored in buffer. 

### Try out with different inputs

Let us compile the program normally and run it with several inputs.

    ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ gcc code1.c -o code1
    

1.  Let us give an input of **4 bytes** :
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ ./code1
        aaaa
        buffer = aaaa, len(buffer) = 4
        

All good. We entered 4 bytes, it genuinely showed 4 bytes.

1.  Input of **6 bytes** :
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ ./code1
        aaaaaa
        buffer = aaaaaa, len(buffer) = 6
        

Even 6 bytes is fine.

if you think about it, any length till **10 bytes** should be perfectly fine because we have a buffer of 10 bytes.

1.  Input of **10 bytes** :
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ ./code1
        aaaaaaaaaa
        buffer = aaaaaaaaaa, len(buffer) = 10
        

All good again, or is it really good? We will think about it a bit later.

Now after 10 bytes, any input should be **invalid** because we don't have memory for input with **length > 10 bytes** . Let us continue our analysis

1.  Input of **11 bytes** :
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ ./code1
        aaaaaaaaaaa
        buffer = aaaaaaaaaaa, len(buffer) = 11
        

Oh shit!! . That was unexpected! So, is there more memory for the buffer or what is happening? Let us continue the analysis

1.  Input of **13 bytes** :
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ ./code1
        aaaaaaaaaaaaa
        buffer = aaaaaaaaaaaaa, len(buffer) = 13
        

2.  Input of **15 bytes** :
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ ./code1
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
        buffer = aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, len(buffer) = 15
        

This has crossed all limits. We cannot accept this kind of behavior from our program.

1.  Input of **17 bytes** :
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ ./code1
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
        buffer = aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, len(buffer) = 17
        

2.  Input of **20 bytes** :
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ ./code1
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
        buffer = aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, len(buffer) = 20
        

3.  Input of **24 bytes** :
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ ./code1
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
        buffer = aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, len(buffer) = 24
        

4.  Input of **28 bytes** :
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ ./code1
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
        buffer = aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, len(buffer) = 28
        *** stack smashing detected ***: ./code1 terminated
        Aborted (core dumped)
        

Finally something happened. For 28 bytes(or from 25 to 28 bytes) we got some error **stack smashing detected** and the program was **terminated** . It was **Aborted** in the middle.

**NOTE** : On your systems, this termination may or may not at 28 bytes, but you would notice this for some length of input. In some machines, the termination would have happened before 28 bytes, in some , you might have to try out longer inputs. But the concept is the same.

A quick recap of what we did.

We have a buffer of 10 bytes. So, we thought that any input upto length = 10 bytes is perfect and valid. But look at this case. It took in way more bytes than expected.Compare 10 bytes and 24 bytes.

It is safe to conclude that something fishy is happening. As security enthusiasts, we will look through the whole program, analyze every bit of it and find out the reason behind this.

### Analysis with length of user input = 4 bytes

1.  Construction of StackFrame:
    
        0x0000000000400646 <+0>:     push   rbp
        0x0000000000400647 <+1>:     mov    rbp,rsp
        0x000000000040064a <+4>:     sub    rsp,0x20
        

Note that the StackFrame is of size **32 bytes** but our buffer size is just **10 bytes** .

Let us start the dynamic analysis.

1.  Let us break at **main**

*   Right now, the size of the StackFrame is 0. This means the top of the stack is the **Old rbp** value. So, **Old rbp = 0x4006c0** .

*   Return Address is the value below Old rbp. So, **Return Address = 0x7ffff7a2d830** . It is important to make note of these values.

1.  Let us go over the next 3 instructions one by one. After executing **sub rsp, 0x20**, this is the state:

*   You can look at the difference. The StackFrame has grown from 0 bytes to 32 bytes. **rsp** has changed. 

1.  Let us execute the next instruction - **mov rax,QWORD PTR fs:0x28** :

*   Before executing it, note that there is a segment register **fs** used here. If you recall, we had discussed that segment registers are still used for some special purposes. Well, this is one of them. Before executing the instruction, let us see what the value of **fs** is.
    
        gdb-peda$ info register fs
        fs             0x0      0x0
        gdb-peda$
        

*   **fs** has a value of 0. It means **fs:0x28** is the address **0 * 16 + 0x28** = **0x28**.

*   Let us try accessing the address **0x28**.
    
        gdb-peda$ x/w 0x28
        0x28:   <error: Cannot access memory at address 0x28>
        gdb-peda$
        

*   This is something to think about. We are not able to access the address 0x28.

*   **NOTE** all the above observations related to the segment register and this instruction. They are important for future discussions.

*   Let's execute the instruction:

1.  let us execute the next instruction - **mov QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],rax** : 

*   That 8-byte number is copied onto memory with address = **rbp-0x8** - which is an address in the StackFrame of 32-bytes.

    *   Observe the **0x7fffffffda00** keenly. It has the Old rbp value in **reverse order** . It is stored like this: 0xc0-0x06-0x40-0x00-0x00-x00-x00-x00 but we know that it's actual value is **0x00-0x00-0x00-0x00-0x00-0x40-0x06-0xc0** or **0x00000000004006c0** . The same goes with the Return Address. We know that Return Address is **0x00007ffff7a2d830** but it is stored in the reverse direction. There is a **fundamental reason** behind this. We will talk about it in detail at the end of the article.
    
    *   Now, Calculate the gap between the **first byte of buffer at 0x7fffffffd9e0** and **Old rbp value at 0x7fffffffda00** is 32-bytes.

1.  The printf functions will all work fine. So, let us analyze statically the following instructions:
    
        0x000000000040069d <+87>:    mov    rcx,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
        => 0x00000000004006a1 <+91>:    xor    rcx,QWORD PTR fs:0x28
        0x00000000004006aa <+100>:   je     0x4006b1 <main+107>
        0x00000000004006ac <+102>:   call   0x400500 <__stack_chk_fail@plt>
        0x00000000004006b1 <+107>:   leave
        0x00000000004006b2 <+108>:   ret
        

*   Note that the 8-byte value in the **stack** is copied into **rcx** register.

*   After copying it into **rcx**, **xor rcx,QWORD PTR fs:0x28** is executed. So, essentially the following is happening:
    
        xor QWORD PTR[rbp-0x8], QWORD PTR fs:0x28 
        

*   Note that it is not a real instruction. It cannot be because both operands are memory locations and that is not possible in Intel Architecture.

*   The **xor** instruction performs **bitwise xor** of the 2 operands present and store the result in the **left/destination operand** .

*   You might be thinking that **fs:0x28** has an 8-byte value = **0x194f8f3c12c69800** . The same value is present at **rbp-0x8** also. So, doesn't **xor** of those give a **0** and finally register rcx will be zero. What kind of security feature is this? xoring the same values, getting a zero and then what? Let us move ahead and see.

*   Next instruction = **je 0x4006b1 < main+107 >** . If the result of **xor** is zero, then the **zero flag** of **EFLAGS** register is set. Note that **zero flag** is also set when 2 things become equal or if their **difference is 0** . So, if the result is 0, then the **jump** of **je 0x4006b1 < main+107 >** is taken. If the result is not zero, then the jump is not taken. Here, the result is zero. So, then jump is taken. Directly it jumps to **< +107 >: leave** .

1.  Executing **leave** instruction: 

*   **Old rbp = 0x4006c0**
*   So, after this is execution, ReturnAddress should be at the top of the stack and the **rbp** register should be loaded with **0x4006c0** . Focussing only on **stack** and **rbp** .

Here, our analysis for one input of length **4 bytes** ends. It was a long analysis because there were a few concepts like the usage of segment register, storing bytes in reverse order etc., to be explained.

Let us do the analysis for InputLength = 28 bytes where was got a new error(**stack smashing detected**) and the program **terminated** . We have got to see why it happened.

### Analysis with length of user input = 28 bytes

This time, we have to stop at these specific points:

    *   0x400657 < main+17 >: mov QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],rax - To checkout the 8-byte value

**NOTE** : The stack addresses while running this time and during previous analysis are different. Do not worry about that.

*   You can see that StackFrame size is 32 bytes. **Old rbp = 0x4006c0** and **Return Address = 0x7ffff7a2d830** . 

1.  Let us run the next instruction - **mov rax,QWORD PTR fs:0x28** : 

*   After this was executed, the rax register has **0x80f8111d0d2a2800** . Note that is is entirely different from the value we saw in previous analysis.

*   Then in the next instruction, the 8-byte value is copied to the stack.

1.  Breakpoint at **scanf** :

    *   Notice that the input entered is way bigger than the buffer. The Input is said to have **overflown** the buffer. We say water is overflowing when it the bucket has reached it's maximum capacity and excess water is coming out of it. The same analogy applies here. Water here is the user input and buffer[10] is the Bucket. The user input is coming out of the buffer because it is bigger that the buffer[10]. I hope you got what buffer overflow is.
    
    *   Note that first 24 bytes are **a**s. The next **4 bytes** are also **a**s. These 4 bytes have overwritten the **last 4 bytes** of the 8-byte value. The Value which was 0x80f8111d0d2a2800 has now become 0x80f8110061616161 . To be accurate, 5-bytes of the 8-byte value has been overwritten. The **NULL** byte of the user input string is also there.

1.  Let us continue and stop at the next breakpoint - **0x40069d < main+87 >**

*   Let us execute **0x40069d < main+87 >: mov rcx,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]** and look at the value of **rcx** .

*   **rcx = 0x80f8110061616161** .

*   We all know what might happen when we try to execute **0x4006a1 < main+91 >: xor rcx,QWORD PTR fs:0x28**

*   **fs:0x28** will have the original value of **0x80f8111d0d2a2800** and **rbp-0x8** has the **tampered** value of **0x80f8110061616161** . As they are not equal, the **xor** doesn't return **0** . So ,the **0x4006aa < main+100 >: je 0x4006b1 < main+107 >** is not executed. If it is not executed, then **0x4006ac < main+102 >: call 0x400500 < __stack_chk_fail@plt >** will get executed.

*   Now, we know that this function **__stack_chk_fail@plt** is executed. Look at the name of the function. It says **Stack Check Failed** . So, this is thefeature we are talking about. That 8-byte value not allow the length of a string in stack go beyond certain length. If it goes, the 8-byte value will get tampered. Let us see what happens if it is tampered.

*   So, the program is aborted.

Our analysis is done now.

These are the key points to be noted:

1.  We understood and witnessed a Buffer Overflow. Woohoo!!

2.  Specifying the buffer size in C programs has no effect on the number of bytes that can be entered by the user. Here, buffer size was 10 bytes, but we could enter input of size more than 10 bytes.

3.  Saw that if that 8-byte value is corrupted, then the program execution comes to an end immediately. We did NOT see how this is benificial. We just saw the program crashed. We will look into it in detail in later posts.

4.  There are functions in C library which are **problematic** - we just saw scanf. It was ready to take in as many bytes as the user entered.

That security feature was not administered till 2003. So, it is interesting and important to see what the scene is without this feature.

Let us start!

## Program2

We will take the following program for analysis:

    ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ cat code2.c
    #include<stdio.h>
    #include<string.h>
    
    void func(char *SrcBuf);
    
    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    
            func(argv[1]);
            return 0;
    }
    
    void func(char *SrcBuf) {
    
            char DstBuf[10];
            strcpy(DstBuf, SrcBuf);
    
            return;
    }
    

*   As we have already seen **scanf**, Let us look at another problematic function in this program - **strcpy** . 

### Overview

1.  **main** function takes 1 argument. 
2.  That argument is passed by reference to a function named **func** . 
3.  **func** has a buffer named **DstBuf** of size = 10 bytes defined. 
4.  The strcpy() function copies Data in 2nd argument into 1st argument. So, SrcBuf - which is the argument we pass to main is copied into DstBuf. 

### Analysis with input size 8 bytes

1.  Let us look at disassembly of **func** - because this is the function under scrutiny.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ gdb -q code2
        Reading symbols from code2...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
        gdb-peda$ disass func
        Dump of assembler code for function func:

        End of assembler dump.
        gdb-peda$
        

*   Let us statically analyze the function.
    
    *   Construction of StackFrame: A StackFrame of 32 bytes is constructed for this function. Note that DstBuf is just 10 bytes.
    
    *   **rdi** has the argument - the address of **argv[1][1]** string. That is copied to location with address **rbp - 0x18** .
    
    *   For strcpy(), **rdi** will have the first argument and should be the address of **DstBuf** . Look at line **< +16 >** and **< +23 >** . **rdi** has the address **rbp-0x10** . So, **Address of DstBuf = rbp-0x10** .
    
    *   **rsi** will have the second argument which is the Address of SrcBuf or argv[1][1].

1.  Let us break at **0x0000000000400569 <+26>: call 0x400400 < strcpy@plt >** . So, we will look at the **stack** before and after it is executed. We will run with "aaaaaaaa" as argument.

    *   **rdi** has the address **0x7fffffffd9c0**. So, this is where **DstBuf** starts. It should end at 0x7fffffffd9c0 + 0xa = **0x7fffffffd9ca** . Note that there is no information about length of DstBuf or Ending address of DstBuf. So, the program has **no** idea of where DstBuf ends. We will see how this is a problem.
    
    *   The **old rbp = 0x7fffffffd9f0** is stored in reverse order at **0x7fffffffd9d0** .
    
    *   **Return Address = 0x0000000000400548** is stored in reverse order at **0x7fffffffd9d8** . Look at main's disassembly and confirm this is the Return Address.
    
    *   **One important thing** : We asked for a buffer of 10 bytes. But we have **16** bytes - 8 bytes addressed by 0x7fffffffd9c0 and the next 8 bytes addressed by 0x7fffffffd9c8. This is because the stack in a 64-bit machine is 8-bytes aligned. So, everything should happen in multiples of 8 in the stack. So, if we had asked for 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or 16 bytes, we would have got a space of 16 bytes. If we had asked for 17 bytes, we would have got 24 bytes. Note this when you write programs. Save space by taking buffers which align to the stack(whose size is a multiple of 8 in 64-bit machines / multiple of 4 in 32-bit machines)

*   Remember that size of argument is **8 bytes** - "aaaaaaaa"

*   Let us go ahead and run **strcpy()**.
    
        gdb-peda$ ni
        

*   Now again, we will look at the stack.

        gdb-peda$
        
    
    *   As expected, "aaaaaaaa" is stored at **0x7fffffffd9c0** .
    
    *   As we spoke about it, it would not matter even if we give 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 bytes because we have been allocated 16bytes for DstBuf. But, why can't we store 16 bytes? Is there a problem? Let us see.

*   Rest of the program is simple. func() returns peacefully to main and main returns back and program exits **normally** .

### Analysis with input size = 16 bytes

1.  We will follow the same procedure. Break at **strcpy** and observe the stack before and after it is executed.

    *   We have a string of length 16 bytes. Where is the NULL character? If you observe, it is present at **0x7fffffffd9c0** which is actually the starting address of **rbp** . So, the NULL character of the string has **overwritten** the **Least Significant Byte of Old rbp**.

*   And it Segfaulted. **SEGV** stands for **Segment Violation** .

*   It says **Invalid $PC address: 0x0** . Look at **rip** value. It is **0**. **rip / Instruction Pointer** always points to the next instruction. Points simply means it has the **address** of the next instruction.

*   If you check, originally the **rbp** of main pointed to **0x7fffffffd9e0 --> 0x400580 (< __libc_csu_init >: push r15)** . That was a valid instruction. But because the **rbp** was changed due to the string we entered, the changed rbp pointed to **0x00**. So, now the program tried to access **0x00**. Well, that is not possible.

*   The program can access the addresses given to it. Refer the **/proc/PID/maps** file. It tells what are the address spaces a particular program can access.

*   Bottom line is that **we were able to change the rbp value** . Here, the NULL value just overwrote 1 byte of rbp.

That's it for this round of analysis

## Extending the thought

*   Look at what we did previously. We changed the value of **rbp** and made the program SegFault.

*   In the previous example, the stack looked something like this:
    
        <Unused: 8-bytes><Value of SrcBuf: 8-bytes><DstBuf: 16-bytes><Oldrbp: 8-bytes><ReturnAddress: 8-bytes>
        

*   We overwrote 1 byte of Oldrbp - which resulted in a SegFault. But is that the only thing we can do?

Absolutely not. There are several other things we can do, like write whatever value we want for **OldRbp** , whatever value we want for **ReturnAddress** .

*   This was a very simple example. Say the stack of some other function looked like this.
    
        <Unused: 8-bytes><Value of SrcBuf: 8-bytes><DstBuf: 16-bytes><Variable1: 4-bytes><Variable2: 4-bytes><Variable 3: 2 bytes><Oldrbp: 8-bytes><ReturnAddress: 8-bytes>
        
    
    *   There are other local variables also. We can overwrite them with **whatever** value we want. It is totally in our hands because those values can be totally controlled by the **input** we give. 

*   And are SegFaults the only unintended behavior? Nope. In many cases, we can give a certain input and **design** the behavior. As in, the software will start behaving the way we want it to behave and not what it's developers wanted it to actually behave.

*   That is like having complete control over the software(and infact the machine). If it is doing what you want to do, then that is gold!

*   One of the best things you can do is to overwrite the **ReturnAddress** with whatever address you want. We will look into it in the next article in detail.

## Coming back to basics

After all these practicals, let us go back to the concepts we discussed in the beginning of the article.

**Vulnerability** : We saw that in these Buffer Overflows we saw, we had complete control over all the values(Can be variables, Old rbp, Return Address) after that Buffer. That is a vulnerability.

**Exploit** : Our inputs were very simple. Just inputting sufficiently long strings was resulting in a Segfault. So, you can think of of those long strings as exploits. Every exploit has a **very specific** aim. The **aim** of these long strings were to just **SegFault** the software. If we want to bring some other behavior other than SegFault, we will have to **write / craft** another exploit for it.

*   **Unintended Behavior** : We discussed about this already. **SegFault** is the unintended behavior we saw. Think about it. If you write software, do you want it to crash? Hell noo! But sorry, we are making it crash. With better exploits, we can bring about behavior which will be useful to us(attacker :P)

*   **Reasons why this vulnerability showed up** : The buffer was 10 bytes. But our inputs were way longer that 10 bytes. So, **User Input** is not being checked. Suppose if we check for Length of user input before copying it into the buffer, then we can necessary action against the inputs. Example: If Input length is <= 10 bytes, happily copy into the buffer. If Input Length is > 10 bytes, copy only the first 10 bytes into the buffer. **Never ever** leave the User Input unchecked. I hope you have got some clarity on what **Sanity Check** is.

*   **Regarding vulnerable functions** : It is sad to say, but there are many of them. A few are **scanf**, **strcpy**, **gets**, **sprintf**, **strcat**, **strncat**, **memcpy** etc., Most of them don't do Length Checking. A few functions do, but under certain conditions, they can be vulnerable again. In this article, we saw 2 functions - **scanf** and **strcpy**. We will use every vulnerable function given as examples in future articles.

*   **Can we do anything about this?** : A big yes. Once we know the reason behind why the vulnerability exists, we have to **patch** it up. In the examples we saw, we could have done 2 things. We could have written code which does the Length checking or we could have used safe functions like **strncpy** in place of **strcpy** or **fgets** in place of **scanf**. These safe functions do take input of a specified length. Look at **fgets** :
    
        char *fgets(char *s, int size, FILE *stream);
        
    
    *   First argument is the BufferName(say buffer or DstBuf). Second takes the **size of the input** to take in. It is generally the size of the Buffer. **stream** is **stdin** because we are accepting inputs from terminal. 

## Summary

1.  Basic concepts like Vulnerability, Exploit, Sanity Check etc., discussed with examples.

2.  Introduced the infamous Buffer Overflow vulnerability and explained those basic concepts with the help of BOF.

3.  We closely looked at the Stack before and after copy/ input, what exactly is happening that is the reason of the vulnerability.

## A few interesting things

#### 1\. Regarding BOF:

This is just a very mild introduction to BOF. In the upcoming articles, we will go into depths of BOF, different exploits for BOF, we will write our **own** exploits to exploit a BOF and more.

#### 2\.The Security Feature in Program1:

I would like to say that it is an amazing security feature and it will take almost a complete post to discuss about it. We will definitely discuss it in one of the future articles.

#### 3\. SegFault as an unintended behavior:

This is the only unintended behavior we could bring about today. Is a SegFault something that an attacker wants to happen in a software? Absolutely. Take this example. There is a web-server which is serving pages to thousands of clients every minute. Suppose the attacker comes to know that there is a BOF and I can segfault the web-server process. Attacker would definitely go for it because the program crashes due to seg-fault. Then the web-server won't be able to serve pages anymore. So, the genuine clients are **denied** of service. So, it results in a **Denial of Service Attack(DoS Attack)** . Of course if any of the modern servers crash, they are designed to come back again. What the attacker will do is, he keeps sending the required input to make the server crash continuously. This again is a DoS attack. Take a look at this [Link][1]. This has a list of BOF vulnerabilities which were/are present in the famous apache web-server. Notice the number of **DoS Overflow** vulnerabilities.

#### 4\. Why are the bytes stored in reverse order?

This is a very important concept and it is important that you understand it properly.

**a**. Let us take an example. Consider the number 0x1122334455667788 to be stored at the address **0x7fffffffd920**. The **normal** / **human** way to store it is like this:

        0x7fffffffd920: 0x11 0x22 0x33 0x44 0x55 0x66 0x77 0x88 
    
        or 
    
        0x7fffffffd920: 0X11 
        0x7fffffffd921: 0X22
        0x7fffffffd922: 0X33
        0x7fffffffd923: 0X44
        0x7fffffffd924: 0X55
        0x7fffffffd925: 0X66
        0x7fffffffd926: 0X77
        0x7fffffffd927: 0X88
    

*   Here, The **Most Significant Byte - 0x11** is stored at the **Lowest Address - 0x7fffffffd920** . The MSB or **Big End** of the 8-byte number is stored at the Lowest Address. 

**b**. We can also store in the number like this:

        0x7fffffffd920: 0x88 0x77 0x66 0x55 0x44 0x33 0x22 0x11
    
        or 
    
        0x7fffffffd920: 0x88
        0x7fffffffd921: 0x77
        0x7fffffffd922: 0x66
        0x7fffffffd923: 0x55
        0x7fffffffd924: 0x44
        0x7fffffffd925: 0x33
        0x7fffffffd926: 0x22
        0x7fffffffd927: 0x11
    

*   This is the **reverse** order. Here, the **Lease Significant Byte - 0x88** is stored at the **Lowest Address - 0x7fffffffd920** . The LSB or "Little End** of the 8-byte number is stored at the Lowest Address. 

The Processor Architecture that follows the **Big-End at Lowest Address byte order** is said to be a **Big-Endian Architecture**. (Not Indian :P, End - ian)

The Processor Architecture that follows the **Little-End at Lowest byte order** is said to be a **Little-Endian Architecture** .

Intel Processors follow the Little-Endian Architecture. The SPARC processor follows Big-Endian Architecture.

In ARM's Cortex-a8 processor, Instructions(Code) is stored in Little-Endian mode. The Data can be stored in either Big-Endian or Little-Endian mode - It is configurable at runtime. Read the discussion [here][2]

Wait, when we have a human-way(Big-Endian way) to store it, why do we even need this Little-Endian architecture?

There are 1 direct advantage of Little-Endian architecture over Big-Endian Architecture.

When you have a variable, the way to access it is by it's Address. We will have it's address and using the address, we access the memory location where the value of the variable is stored.

Consider the following C program:

        ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ cat code3.c
        #include<stdio.h>
        int main() {
    
                unsigned long var = 0x1122334455667788;
                printf("Address of var = %p\n", &var);
                printf("var = 0x%lx, (unsigned)var = 0x%x, (unsigned short)var = 0x%x, (unsigned char)var = 0x%x\n", var, (unsigned)var, (unsigned short)var, (unsigned char)var);
    
                return 0;
        }
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ gcc code3.c -o code3
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_7$ ./code3
        Address of var = 0x7fff632baf50
        var = 0x1122334455667788, (unsigned)var = 0x55667788, (unsigned short)var = 0x7788, (unsigned char)var = 0x88
    

Let us think about how the processor accesses it, how much time it takes to access these bytes.

**1**. Little-Endian Architecture:

This is how it is stored.

        0x7fff632baf50: 0x88 
        0x7fff632baf51: 0x77
        0x7fff632baf52: 0x66
        0x7fff632baf53: 0x55
        0x7fff632baf54: 0x44
        0x7fff632baf55: 0x33
        0x7fff632baf56: 0x22
        0x7fff632baf57: 0x11
    

*   If I want Byte 0((unsigned char)var), then I would just pick the first byte.

*   If I want Byte 0 and Byte 1((unsigned short)var), then I would pick the first byte and byte next to it.

*   If I want Byte 0, 1, 2 and 3((unsigned)var), then I would I would pick the first byte, byte next to it, byte next to it and the byte next to it.

*   Same goes with the whole number.

The point to understand is we are casting the same address into several datatypes. Whether you want to take 1 byte, 2 bytes, 4 bytes or 8 bytes, the Address always will be 0x7fff632baf50. The instructions change. For 1 byte, we know it will be BYTE PTR[address], for 2 bytes - WORD PTR[address] and so on.

So, casting takes no time.

**1**. Big-Endian Architecture:

This is how it is stored.

        0x7fff632baf50: 0x11 
        0x7fff632baf51: 0x22
        0x7fff632baf52: 0x33
        0x7fff632baf53: 0x44
        0x7fff632baf54: 0x55
        0x7fff632baf55: 0x66
        0x7fff632baf56: 0x77
        0x7fff632baf57: 0x88
    

*   Suppose I want 1 byte(the first byte), then I calculate the address of 0x88, then access it. Because what you have is 0x7fff632baf50. To access 0x88, I will have to do 0x7fff632baf50 + 0x7.

*   Suppose I want 2 bytes(0x7788), then I calculate address of 0x88, access it. Probably maintain a pointer to 0x88 which can be decremented to obtain 0x77(this is better than computing address of 0x77 ).

*   Suppose I want 4 bytes(0x55667788), then I calculate the address of 0x88, access it. Decrement pointer and access every byt till 0x55.

In this example, Little-Endian does less work to complete the same task.

One advantage of Big-Endian over Little-Endian arch is,

In a network, all Bytes travel in Big-endian fashion. So, A Little-Endian machine has to convert the bytes to Big-Endian before sending it across the network. It also has to convert back to Little-Endian when it receives the bytes. A Big-Endian machines doesn't have to any of this. It will simply keep quiet.

These are just 2 aspects of Little-Endian and Big-Endian architecture which was discussed.

Look at [this][3] quora answer. It is really good and has links to other sites which explain the differences.

I hope you have got clarity on what Little and Big Endian architectures are and why bytes are stored in reverse order in the Intel Processors.

#### 5\. What is nop?

We encountered this instruction called **nop** during our analysis. **nop** is short form for **No-OPeration** . It is what it's name says. It does nothing. **nop** is just a name for the instruction **xchg eax, eax** which does nothing. The reason why we need **nop** requires an indepth understanding of Processor Architecture, so probably in another post.

*   Note that **nop** instructions help a lot in writing good exploits. How and why of this statement will be answered in later articles. You will clearly understand it when you write your exploit. 

With that, I hope I have covered almost all loose ends we had during analysis.

## Conclusion

I realize that the post is a bit long, but the objective was to learn basic concepts, introduce BOF and I felt it would be better if all basics are in one article. Please go through the article slowly, understand every bit of it.

The best way to clearly understand all these concepts is to write small programs, play around with it, get segfaults etc.,

That is it for this post. We will continue from here in the next post. I really enjoyed writing this post. I hope you learn something new out of this.

Thanks you!
