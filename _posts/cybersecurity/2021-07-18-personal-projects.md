## Projects

1. [TheBEBook](https://github.com/adwait1-G/TheBEBook): A book I am writing to introduce a layman to Binary Exploitation. Felt that the RE-BE series is still not good enough for beginners. Hence this effort. Currently, it has material which are pre-requisites to the RE-BE series present in this blog. Actively updated.
1. [ROPilicious](https://github.com/ROPilicious/src): Automated the ROP exploit generation to a certain extent. It is capable of harvesting the gadgets, syntax-based chaining and can generate different payloads. The tool is written in such a way that one can write a script to generate a new type of payload. Please read through its README for more details.
2. [Practical Malware Analysis](https://github.com/adwait1-G/Practical-Malware-Analysis): My progress on the Practical Malware Analysis book. I have documented the things which felt important - concepts, Windows functions, techniques for reversing/analysis etc., This is how I got introduced to Windows reversing, PE/COFF binaries.
3. [Write your own XXXX](https://www.pwnthebox.net/write/your/own/xxxx/2019/09/10/write-your-own-xxxx-mainpage.html): Writing tools to understand stuff.
    - I have written [libelfp](/write/your/own/xxxx/2019/11/15/elf-parser-home.html), a simple ELF parsing library with simple, neat C API.
4. [packcap](https://github.com/adwait1-G/packcap): A simple packet headers' parser. Goal was to understand the Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP protocols' headers better - thereby understand the protocols better.
5. This blog itself is a lifelong project for me.

## Workshops

1. [Introduction to Named Data Networks - an awesome Internet architecture](/assets/talks-and-workshops/named-data-networks - an-introduction.pdf)
2. [How does the internet work?](https://github.com/adwait1-G/How-does-the-Internet-work)
3. [The Perfect Hack!](https://github.com/adwait1-G/ieee_workshop)
4. [Workshop on Buffer Overflow and related exploit methods](https://github.com/adwait1-G/bof-and-exploits): Conducted in Cisco SecCon 2021.

CTFs: Along with my team, I conducted 2 college-level CTFs in 2018 and 2019. [eCTF 2018](https://github.com/rsa-ctf/ectf2018), [eCTF 2019](https://github.com/WebClub-NITK/eCTF-2019). I mostly wrote the reversing, exploitation and forensics challenges.
