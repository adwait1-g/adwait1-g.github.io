Hey fellow pwners!

This is the first post of Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation Tutorial Series. We will discuss how a C/C++ program is converted into an executable, which can be run on the system.

Prerequisites: You should have a Linux machine running. If you are using Windows, you can follow this youtube video([Link][1]) and easily install Ubuntu - a student friendly Linux flavor.

Let us start!

Before starting with today's topic, fire up the terminal(**Ctrl+Alt+T**). Let us create a directory named **rev_eng_series** in home directory using **mkdir**(make directory) command and enter that directory using **cd**(change directory) command.

    $ mkdir rev_eng_series
    $ cd rev_eng_series
    ~/rev_eng_series$ 
    

This is our first post. So, let us create a directory named **post_1** inside rev_eng_series directory and traverse into it.

    ~/rev_eng_series$ mkdir post_1
    ~/rev_eng_series$ cd post_1
    ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ 
    

Let us store all the code or anything we do in this post in **post_1** directory. This way, we can keep track of our work.

Let us first understand what Compilation means. The dictionary meaning of Compilation is **The action or process of producing something**. Here, we will take a simple C program and see the process of producing an **executable**. This is the sourcecode of C program used.

    ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ cat code1.c 
    
    #include<stdio.h>
    #include<stdio.h>    
    
    #define NUMBER 100
    
    int a = 10;              //Global variable 'a' initialized to 10.
    int b;                   //Global variable uninitialized.
    
    int main() {
        int c = 123,number = NUMBER;
        char d = 'x';
    
        printf("Hello world!\n");
    
        return 0;
    }
    

## Overview

Let us look at the overview of whole conversion process. Later, we will get into details.

*   The **gcc** compiler(GNU C Compiler - gcc) takes the C sourcefile as an argument and **generates** an executable file. Store the above C sourcefile as **code1.c** and compile it in the following manner.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ gcc code1.c -o code1
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ ls -l code1
        -rwxrwxr-x 1 adwi adwi 8656 Jun 18 22:20 code1
        

*   **code1** is the executable generated. Open it up in a text editor(Eg: **vi**) and see how it looks like. It looks all weird because it is direct machine code(**0s & 1s**), along with some **metadata** and few useful **strings**.

*   Conversion of a C/C++ sourcefile (**.c / .cpp** files) to **executable file** is **not** a single step process, though it might feel like a single step process. Look at the following diagram: 

                                                    Preprocessing
                                                --------------------- 
          C source code (hello.c)   ----------> |   Preprocessor    | ---------->   hello.i (Intermediate C sourcefile)
                                                ---------------------

                                                      Compiling
                                                ---------------------            
                         hello.i    ----------> |     Compiler      | ---------->   hello.s (Assembly code)
                                                ---------------------

                                                      Assembling
                                                ---------------------
                         hello.s    ----------> |     Assembler     | ---------->   hello.o (Object code)
                                                ---------------------
                        
                                                        Linking
                                                ---------------------
             hello.o + Libraries    ----------> |       Linker      | ---------->   hello / a.out (Executable)     
                                                ---------------------                



*   The conversion process constitutes of 4 **sub-processes**. They are **Preprocessing**, **Compiling**, **Assembling** and **Linking**. The objective of this post is to understand each of these sub-processes in detail.

*   Let us compile code1.c in the following manner. This helps our analysis.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ gcc code1.c -o code1 -save-temps
        

*   Generally, output files generated by **Preprocessor**, **Compiler** and **Assembler** are stored temporarily in **/tmp** directory which are deleted as soon as the **executable** is generated. But with **-save-temps** option, we will save those temporary files also, which will help in our analysis. There are 4 sub-processes, so 4 files are generated. **code1.i**, **code1.s**, **code1.o** and **code1**. **code1** is the final executable.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ ls -l 
        total 44
        -rwxrwxr-x 1 adwi adwi  8656 Jun 18 22:55 code1
        -rw-rw-r-- 1 adwi adwi   220 Jun 18 22:53 code1.c
        -rw-rw-r-- 1 adwi adwi 17156 Jun 18 22:54 code1.i

         adwi@adwi:~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ 
        

Go through the C program thoroughly. Let us start our analysis.

## 1\. Preprocessing :

*   The **C-Preprocessor** / **CPP** does the Preprocessing.(Do not get confused between this CPP and .cpp file extension given to C++ sourcefiles).

*   It generates **code1.i** file. **i** stands for **intermediate**.

*   **CPP** takes **code1.c** (original C sourcefile) as input and outputs **code1.i**.

*   CPP does a lot of work before sourcefile goes to next sub-process. They are

**a**. Expand all the **#include** s (here, #include < stdio.h >) which are included in C sourcefile : Expand means simple copy contents of a header file into C sourcefile. A header file generally consists of

**1**. Different **function declarations** related to the header file(Eg: stdio.h will have function declarations of standard input and output functions).     
**2**. Different macros defined.     
**3**. **#include** of other related header files.           
**4**. A bunch of **typedef** s of different datatypes.           

**b**. Replace **MACROS**(here, #define NUMBER 100) with their actual values: Wherever macro **NUMBER** would be used in C sourcefile, it would be replaced by it's value.

Have a look at the last few lines of code1.i file

    extern int pclose (FILE *__stream);
    extern char *ctermid (char *__s) __attribute__ ((__nothrow__ , __leaf__));
    # 912 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 3 4
    extern void flockfile (FILE *__stream) __attribute__ ((__nothrow__ , __leaf__));
    extern int ftrylockfile (FILE *__stream) __attribute__ ((__nothrow__ , __leaf__)) ;
    extern void funlockfile (FILE *__stream) __attribute__ ((__nothrow__ , __leaf__));
    # 942 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 3 4
    
    # 2 "code1.c" 2
    
    # 5 "code1.c"
    int a = 10;
    int b;
    
    int main() {
     int c = 123, number = 100;
     char d = 'x';
    
     printf("Hello world!!\n");
    
     return 0; 
    }
    

Observe that all those are function declarations. If you open code1.i using vi and explore, you would realize what we are discussing. Also observe that **number = NUMBER** is changed to **number = 100**. The macro was replaced by it's value.

**c**. **Conditional compilation** : In our example, **stdio.h** is included twice. When a variable is declared twice, we generally get an error saying the variable is already declared once. But here we are including stdio.h twice, meaning the same set of variables, function declarations, other statements are being used twice. But we never got an error while compiling right? Let us understand why. Look at the first few lines of **stdio.h**(Located at **/usr/include/stdio.h**).

    #ifndef _STDIO_H
    
    #if !defined __need_FILE && !defined __need___FILE
    # define _STDIO_H   1
    

And last line of **stdio.h** is

    #endif /* !_STDIO_H */
    

Here, conditional compilation is used to make sure **stdio.h** is included **only** once. If **_STDIO_H** is not defined(#ifndef _STDIO_H), then define \_STDIO\_H as 1(#define _STDIO_H 1). _STDIO_H is a macro used which is defined to 1. When the second #include< stdio.h > is processed, it will first check whether _STDIO_H is defined or not. In this case, _STDIO_H is already defined to be 1. So, all contents after #ifndef is ignored. This way, only the first #include< stdio.h > is considered. The #ifndef is ended by **#endif** at the end of header file. If you checkout stdio.h (or any other header file for that matter) in detail, you will find a lot of conditional compilation used.

*   All header files are located in **/usr/include** directory.

*   At the end of preprocessing, we have **code1.i** which is also C sourcecode, with the above mentioned changes.

## 2\. Compiling :

*   First thing to understand at this point is, Compiling is 1 of 4 sub-processes. But we generally call the whole conversion process as Compiling / Compilation. It is important to note this.

*   **Compiler** takes **code1.i** file as input, **compiles** it and gives **code1.s** file as output. **s** in code1.s stands for **source**. At the time when programmers were writing programs in assembly(before any compiled languages were invented), they used to name the assembly code sourcefiles with **.s** extension. Now, the same convention is followed.

*   **code1.s** is the **assembly** equivalent of **code1.c**. The machine I am using is a 64-bit Intel machine. Assembly language which can be understood by this machine is **x86_64 assembly language**. So, the compiler generates assembly code in x86_64 language. Take a look at **code1.s** .
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ cat code1.s
            .file   "code1.c"
            .globl  a
            .data
            .align 4
            .type   a, @object
            .size   a, 4
        a:
            .long   10
            .comm   b,4,4
            .section    .rodata
        .LC0:
            .string "Hello world!!"
            .text
            .globl  main
            .type   main, @function
        main:
        .LFB0:
            .cfi_startproc
            pushq   %rbp
            .cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
            .cfi_offset 6, -16
            movq    %rsp, %rbp
            .cfi_def_cfa_register 6
            subq    $16, %rsp
            movl    $123, -8(%rbp)
            movl    $100, -4(%rbp)
            movb    $120, -9(%rbp)
            movl    $.LC0, %edi
            call    puts
            movl    $0, %eax
            leave
            .cfi_def_cfa 7, 8
            ret
            .cfi_endproc
        .LFE0:
            .size   main, .-main
            .ident  "GCC: (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.9) 5.4.0 20160609"
            .section    .note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
        

*   **Unlike** the way we have one C programming language, every processor in the market has a different **architecture** and is designed to understand a specific assembly language. That way, there are many assembly languages, each present to run on a specific processor. There cannot be 2 entirely different assembly languages for the same processor. Few Examples of processors and their assembly languages are

**a.** Intel's core i7 - x86_64 assembly lang

**b.** Intel's Pentium - x86 assembly lang

**c.** IBM's PowerPC - ppc, ppc64 assembly lang

**d.** Oracle's Sparc - SPARC assembly lang

*   If we have a ppc **.s** file, it can run only on a PowerPC machine and it **cannot** run on Intel processors.

*   Compiler does a lot of processing to generate **.s** file from **.c/.cpp** file. Let us not get into Compiler design but we will understand what all a compiler does.

    **a**. Conversion of C/C++ programs to assembly language.

    **b**. It does all the optimizations required(unless you don't want it).

    **c**. It eliminates dead code. Sometimes, there will be pieces of code which will never get executed . Such pieces are identified and removed .

    **d**. One of the most important one. It **strips** or **removes** names and datatypes of **local variables**. If you refer code1.c file, there were **3** local variables - **int c = 123**, **number = NUMBER** and **char d = 'x'**. If you search for these names **c, number, d** or their respective datatypes, you won't be able to find in **code1.s** file because it has been removed by the compiler.

*   We have **code1.s**, the assembly lang equivalent with us after compilation sub-process.

### 3\. Assembling :

*   A system program called **Assembler** assembles **code1.s** to give **code1.o** file.

*   The **.o** in code1.o stands for **object**.

*   An **object file** has pure machine code(**0s & 1s**) along with some metadata useful for next sub-process.

*   If you open code1.o with a text editor, it is really hard to understand what it contains. So, let us use a command-line tool called **objdump** to analyze it's contents.

*   **objdump** stands for object dump, which means "give the dump of object file specified". Let us see what that **dump** contains. This is how you use **objdump**. The file **code1.o.objdump** will have the **dump**. (Do not worry about the file extensions. They are given just to make our job easy. Linux OSs do not give much importance to extensions of files)
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ objdump -Mintel -D code1.o > code1.o.objdump
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$
        

*   It typically has 5 sections: **.text**, **.data**, **.rodata**, **.comment** and **.eh_frame**. We have got the **disassembly** of each section present in code1.o object file. Disassembly means, disassembling / undoing the assembled file(object file) and getting it's assembly code back(with certain changes). Let us focus on the first 3 sections: **.text**, **.data** and **.rodata**.

**a**. **.text section** : This section consists of machine code of all functions we would have written in C sourcefile. In our example, main is the only function. Take a look at this.

        code1.o:     file format elf64-x86-64
    
    
        Disassembly of section .text:
    
        0000000000000000 <main>:
           0:   55                      push   rbp
           1:   48 89 e5                mov    rbp,rsp
           4:   48 83 ec 10             sub    rsp,0x10
           8:   c7 45 f8 7b 00 00 00    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x7b
           f:   c7 45 fc 64 00 00 00    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x64
          16:   c6 45 f7 78             mov    BYTE PTR [rbp-0x9],0x78
          1a:   bf 00 00 00 00          mov    edi,0x0
          1f:   e8 00 00 00 00          call   24 <main+0x24>
          24:   b8 00 00 00 00          mov    eax,0x0
          29:   c9                      leave  
          2a:   c3                      ret    
    

*   Note on objdump output: First column from right (**push rbp**, **mov rbp, rsp** etc.,) are assembly instructions. The middle column is **hexadecimal** equivalent of those assembly instructions. You can think of First column from left as serial numbers for now.

*   We observed that names and datatypes of local variables are removed during compilation. Instead of names and datatypes, compiler gives an address space of 4 bytes for integers, 1 byte for character variables. Eg: 0x7b = 123 in decimal. It is stored at address **rbp - 0x08**(Do not worry about what rbp is, will explain in next post in detail). So, whenever we refer to variable **c** in our C program(in code1.c), at assembly level, it is being referred by **rbp-0x08**. This is a rough example. Will give clear details about this in the next post.

**b**. **.data section** : This section consists of **Global** and **static** variables. Ideally, objdump should give disassembly of only text section because that is the only section containing machine code. But, objdump is not intelligent enough. That is why, it is disassembling even .data section which you don't have to worry about.

        Disassembly of section .data:
    
        0000000000000000 <a>:
           0:   0a 00                   or     al,BYTE PTR [rax]
    

**c**. **rodata section** : This section consists of all **read-only(ro)** data. In our example, **Hello world!!\n** string is the only read-only item in the file.

        Disassembly of section .rodata:
    
        0000000000000000 <.rodata>:
           0:   48                      rex.W
           1:   65 6c                   gs ins BYTE PTR es:[rdi],dx
           3:   6c                      ins    BYTE PTR es:[rdi],dx
           4:   6f                      outs   dx,DWORD PTR ds:[rsi]
           5:   20 77 6f                and    BYTE PTR [rdi+0x6f],dh
           8:   72 6c                   jb     76 <main+0x76>
           a:   64 21 21                and    DWORD PTR fs:[rcx],esp
    

*   If you closely look, **0x48** is ascii number for **H**, **0x65** for **e**, **0x6c** for **l** and so on. You can use **ascii** command line tool for reference. If it not installed, you can install it in this way.

*   **NOTE**:
    
    *   Every instruction and section should have an address right? But here all sections are starting with address **zero**. How can 2 section have same address or be at the same address??
    
    *   Observe **.data section**. There is no mention of **int b**, the **uninitialized global variable**. But if we have used it, it should be somewhere right?
    
    *   The data present in .rodata section cannot be executed by the processor. It is read-only, non-executable, non-writable data. objdump simply converted the data in .rodata section to it's assembly equivalent, but it makes no sense because the whole section is non-executable section.
    
    *   Observe **.text section**. There is not mention of **printf** we had used in code1.c . But note that there is a **call** instruction(**1f:** line).
    
    *   There are more, but these are the important ones.

To resolve few of the issues mentioned above, let us use another tool called **readelf** to analyze code1.o .

*   **ELF**: stands for **Executable and Linkable Format**. For now, it is enough to know that any file which we want to execute on a Linux machine must be in this format.A file of any other format cannot be run even if it has machine code in it. Similar to ELF, Windows has it's own executable format. It is known as **PE**( **Portable Executable** ) file format.

**a**. Object file(here code1.o) contains a table known as **Symbol Table**. Take a look at this symbol table.

        ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ readelf -s code1.o
    
        Symbol table '.symtab' contains 13 entries:
           Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
             0: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  UND 
             1: 0000000000000000     0 FILE    LOCAL  DEFAULT  ABS code1.c
             2: 0000000000000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    1 
             3: 0000000000000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    3 
             4: 0000000000000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    4 
             5: 0000000000000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    5 
             6: 0000000000000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    7 
             7: 0000000000000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    8 
             8: 0000000000000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    6 
             9: 0000000000000000     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT    3 a
            10: 0000000000000004     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT  COM b
            11: 0000000000000000    43 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    1 main
            12: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND puts
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ 
    

*   Focus on symbol numbers **9**, **10**, **11** and **12**. Their names are **a**, **b**, **main** and **puts** respectively.
    
    *   **a** is a **global object** of size 4 bytes.
    
    *   **b** is a **global object** of size 4 bytes. **COM** stands for **COMMON** symbol.
    
    *   **main** is a **global function** of size 43 bytes.
    
    *   **puts** is a **global** symbol, but it's type is not known(**NOTYPE**). So, at this stage, assembler does not know what **puts** is(though we know it). NOTE: When there are no format strings in printf(), some compilers replace printf() with puts(). That is why, there is a puts() here instead of printf().

**b**. Object file also has a section called **Relocation Section**. have a look at this:

        ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ readelf -r code1.o
    
        Relocation section '.rela.text' at offset 0x240 contains 2 entries:
          Offset          Info           Type           Sym. Value    Sym. Name + Addend
        00000000001b  00050000000a R_X86_64_32       0000000000000000 .rodata + 0
        000000000020  000c00000002 R_X86_64_PC32     0000000000000000 puts - 4
    
        Relocation section '.rela.eh_frame' at offset 0x270 contains 1 entries:
          Offset          Info           Type           Sym. Value    Sym. Name + Addend
        000000000020  000200000002 R_X86_64_PC32     0000000000000000 .text + 0
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ 
    

*   We will come to the meaning of **Relocation** in the next sub-process.
    
    *   Now, just observe that there are 2 symbols **.rodata** and **puts** in **.rela.text** section. 

*   This means code1.o has information about **puts()** in it's **Symbol Table** and **Relocation Section**.

We rectified a few issues mentioned in the NOTE, but not all. We still have to see what **relocation** is and what happens to **puts**.

### 4\. Linking :

*   The last part of conversion is **linking** and is done by a system program called **linker**. It takes one or more object files and **Shared Libraries**(like **libc**) as input. If Linking is successful, it generates the executable file. Else, it gives a **Linking** Error.

*   An object file has no absolute addresses. Every section started with address 0 and other stuff in a particular section was numbered relative to starting address 0. But this is not possible in an actual executable file. Every section should have a definite / absolute address. The Linker Relocates(or shifts) each section in such a manner that every section has a **unique** starting address. This the meaning of Relocation.

*   Linker links symbols present in Relocation Table to their **definitions** . This is known as **Symbol Resolution**. Eg:
    
    *   The symbol **main** is linked to **.text + 0x00** because that is where body of main function is defined. Then how and what will it link **puts** to? We just have it's symbol in Relocation Table, but we never explicitly defined it anywhere in out C program.
    
    *   The linker finds the definition of **puts** in **libc** / Standard C Library and will link **puts** to that .

*   Linker then gives absolute address to every section in object file and adds a few more sections , thus making it a complete executable file.

*   Let us check out **code1** executable file using **readelf**.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ readelf -r code1
        
        Relocation section '.rela.dyn' at offset 0x380 contains 1 entries:
          Offset          Info           Type           Sym. Value    Sym. Name + Addend
        000000600ff8  000300000006 R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT 0000000000000000 __gmon_start__ + 0
        
        Relocation section '.rela.plt' at offset 0x398 contains 2 entries:
          Offset          Info           Type           Sym. Value    Sym. Name + Addend
        000000601018  000100000007 R_X86_64_JUMP_SLO 0000000000000000 puts@GLIBC_2.2.5 + 0
        000000601020  000200000007 R_X86_64_JUMP_SLO 0000000000000000 __libc_start_main@GLIBC_2.2.5 + 0
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ 
        
    
    *   Observe the first entry of **.rela.plt** section. There is **puts**. Linker has identified that it is a C library function. In normal situations, libc functions are Dynamically Linked. That is, their definitions will be present in **libc.so** shared object file. They are given absolute addresses when they are called. That is why it is known as Dynamic Linking.
    
    *   Finally, we will just look at **disassembly** of main function in the executable file and wrap up the post.
        
            ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ objdump -Mintel -D code1 > code1.objdump
            
    
    *   This is the main function:
        
            0000000000400526 <main>:
              400526:       55                      push   rbp
              400527:       48 89 e5                mov    rbp,rsp
              40052a:       48 83 ec 10             sub    rsp,0x10
              40052e:       c7 45 f8 7b 00 00 00    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x7b
              400535:       c7 45 fc 64 00 00 00    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x64
              40053c:       c6 45 f7 78             mov    BYTE PTR [rbp-0x9],0x78
              400540:       bf e4 05 40 00          mov    edi,0x4005e4
              400545:       e8 b6 fe ff ff          call   400400 <puts@plt>
              40054a:       b8 00 00 00 00          mov    eax,0x0
              40054f:       c9                      leave
              400550:       c3                      ret
              400551:       66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00    nop    WORD PTR cs:[rax+rax*1+0x0]
              400558:       00 00 00
              40055b:       0f 1f 44 00 00          nop    DWORD PTR [rax+rax*1+0x0]
            
    
    *   You can notice that every instruction has an absolute address. There is a **call 400400< puts@plt >** which is a call to **puts** function. You can go through the whole code1.objdump. Every byte has a unique address. All the sections .data , .rodata etc., have absolute addresses. There are new sections added by the linker to make it a working executable.
    
    *   That was about Linking. If you do not get any linking errors, you will have an executable in the directory, which can be run in the following manner.
        
            ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ /code1 
            Hello world!! 
            ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$
            

This is how an executable is generated from a C/C++ program.

### A few other interesting things :

1.  If there is only 1 C sourcefile like code1.c, an executable is generated in the above explained manner. But huge projects will have multiple sourcefiles. How is this situation handled?
    
    *   Let is take an example and understand what happens. Consider 2 C sourcefiles **source1.c** and **source2.c**.
        
            ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ cat source1.c 
            #include<stdio.h>
            void func();
            
            int main() {
            
                printf("In main()\n");
                func();
            }
            ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ cat source2.c
            void func() {
            
                printf("In func()\n");
                main();
            }
            ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ 
            
    
    *   Compile these 2 files in the following manner.
        
            ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ gcc source1.c source2.c -o target -save-temps
            
    
    *   Go through the warnings you get. It is alright to ignore these warnings. You will have these files after compilation.
        
            ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ ls -l source*
            -rw-rw-r-- 1 adwi adwi    82 Jun 21 21:12 source1.c
            -rw-rw-r-- 1 adwi adwi 17121 Jun 21 21:19 source1.i
            -rw-rw-r-- 1 adwi adwi  1568 Jun 21 21:19 source1.o
            -rw-rw-r-- 1 adwi adwi   481 Jun 21 21:19 source1.s
            -rw-rw-r-- 1 adwi adwi    50 Jun 21 21:12 source2.c
            -rw-rw-r-- 1 adwi adwi   182 Jun 21 21:19 source2.i
            -rw-rw-r-- 1 adwi adwi  1568 Jun 21 21:19 source2.o
            -rw-rw-r-- 1 adwi adwi   471 Jun 21 21:19 source2.s
            ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ ls -l target
            -rwxrwxr-x 1 adwi adwi 8672 Jun 21 21:19 target
            
    
    *   You can notice that there is a .i file, .s file and an object file(.o) for each of C sourcefiles. From this you can conclude that each C sourcefile is preprocessed, compiled and assembled **independently**. Then all the object files along with shared libraries are taken by the linker and are **stitched** together to give **1** executable **target** here.
    
    *   This is how executable is generated when there are multiple C sourcefiles.

2.  Determining the **Entry Point** of execution:
    
    *   When an executable is run, there is always a starting point( or a first instruction) from where execution starts. We have written the main function. It is normal to think that **main** is the entry point of execution. But let us go a little deep into this. Using **readelf** tool, let us analyze the executable's(code1) header.
        
               ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ readelf -h code1
               ELF Header:
               Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
               Class:                             ELF64
               Data:                              2's complement, little endian
               Version:                           1 (current)
               OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V
               ABI Version:                       0
               Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)
               Machine:                           Advanced Micro Devices X86-64
               Version:                           0x1
               Entry point address:               0x400430
               Start of program headers:          64 (bytes into file)
               Start of section headers:          6672 (bytes into file)
               Flags:                             0x0
               Size of this header:               64 (bytes)
               Size of program headers:           56 (bytes)
               Number of program headers:         9
               Size of section headers:           64 (bytes)
               Number of section headers:         31
               Section header string table index: 28
               ~/rev_eng_series/post_1$ 
            
    
    *   Look at the 10th entry. It says **Entry point address** = **0x400430**. Take a look at starting address of main function. It is **0x400526**. This means **main** function is not the entry point. Open **code1.objdump** in a text editor and check for address **0x400430**.
    
    *   A **label** called **_start** is the entry point of **any** executable. This requires some explanation. In the object file(code1.o), we have machine code of all the functions and other important sections. For the system to run these functions(in our example, only main function), the system should be prepared to execute functions which we have written. All the preparation and initialization should take place before **main** function. So, the linker identifies a label named **_start** as entry point. From _start till main function is called, all the preparation happens. After that, **main** is called.
    
    *   **_start** label is a compulsory label. In future posts when we try out direct assembly programming, we never use main. We start the program with **_start** because **linker** searches for it while linking.
    
    *   So, **main** is a function like any other we write but with a few special properties from a programmer's point of view.
    
    *   We can say that **main** is the entry point from **programmer's** perspective and **_start** is the entry point from **system's** perspective.

3.  A small note on usage of **#define**:
    
    *   As we discussed in the post, all the macros are replaced by their values by CPP. So, these macros (NUMBER) never get processed by the compiler. Consider the following scenario.
        
        *   There is a huge code base that you have not written and there is a macro **#define NUMBER 100** in one of the sourcefiles which you are not aware of. When you compile it, suppose you are getting an error related to this number **100**. The compiler gives where exactly the error is. But you would never know that the **100** was a macro first, which got processed by CPP. We would not even know if it is a macro. Even if we somehow come to know, it is really hard to find this macro in the huge code base.
        
        *   There is a solution for this. Instead of **#define NUMBER 100**, you can use **const int NUMBER = 100**. So, when there is a compilation error, we will know that error is with **NUMBER** because it is a variable and not a macro. From system's perspective, we are using 4 extra bytes. But the ease of maintenance and ease with which we can catch the errors is enhanced.
        
        *   Sometimes, we use **#define** to define small functions like finding square of a number. For the same reason stated above, you can use **inline** functions instead of **#define**.

### Conclusion :

I hope this post has given an idea on how a C/C++ program is converted in an executable. I suggest to read this slowly and understand than to rush through the article.

There were many things related to Symbol table, Relocation table which we did not get into detail. We will take it up in the next post. Next post will be on **Internal Structure of an executable file**. We will discuss what ELF is in detail, what dynamic linking is, how exactly a function like puts() is linked at runtime and more.

That is it for this post. I thoroughly enjoyed writing it. Hope you enjoyed reading it :)
