title: Exploitation using Code Injection - Part1
categories: Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation series
---

Hey fellow pwners!

In the previous article, we saw what **Control Flow Hijacking** in detail along with a couple of examples. We saw how a BOF can be exploited to execute an exploit function present in the software.

It was a good example to understand Control Flow Hijacking. But a problem with it was that no software would have such **evil** exploit functions in it. No developer would add malicious code along with the original software.

So, is there a more realistic way to write exploits to abuse vulnerable software? A Big Yes!

In this article, we will look at one of the most famous exploit methods known as **Code Injection** Exploit method. This method doesn't expect any exploit function to be present in the vulnerable software to exploit it. It is like a standalone method which does a great job.

Before we start, let us disable the security feature which randomizes addresses(refer to the previous article). This makes our experimentation easier.

    ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space 
    2
    

The value in the file **randomize_va_space** is **2**. Which means the Operating System is instructed to randomize addresses. If it is set to **0**, then we are telling the Operating System to stop all the randomization. So, let us do that.

    ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ echo 0 >  /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space 
    bash: /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space: Permission denied
    
    ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ sudo echo 0 >  /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space 
    bash: /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space: Permission denied
    
    ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ sudo su root
    [sudo] password for adwi: 
    /home/adwi/rev_eng_series/post_8# sudo echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
    /home/adwi/rev_eng_series/post_8# 
    

Note that even **sudo** cannot do this. You **must** be root to do this change. This signifies how important a security feature this is to the Operating System. We will talk about this in detail in one of the future posts.

These are the contents in this article:

1.  A quick recap!
2.  What does executing machine code mean? - Explained with an example
3.  What is a System Call? - An important Operating System concept to be understood before we dive into actual code injection. 
4.  Code Injection - Introduction

With this done, let us start!

# A quick recap!

Let us quickly recap what we had done in the previous article. Let us take the following example:

    ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ cat code1.c
    #include<stdio.h>
    #include<string.h>
    
    void vuln_func() {
    
            char buffer[100];
            gets(buffer);
            printf("%s\n", buffer);
            return;
    }
    
    int main() {
    
            printf("Before vuln_func. \n");
            vuln_func();
            printf("After vuln_func. \n");
    
            return 0;
    }
    

*   The example in the previous article had another function called **exploit_func**. The objective was to exploit the BOF and execute that function. The key was to overwrite the **Return Address** of **vuln_func** with the starting address of **exploit_func**. So, vuln_func instead of returning the control back to main, the control goes over to **exploit_func**.

*   Our point is no such evil, exploit function would be present in any software and I feel this is a valid argument. So, what do we do?

*   Check this out. In the examples we have seen so far, the buffer was being filled with crap and we only cared what value the Return Address was being overwritten with. In this article, we will see how we can write some exploit code we want to execute in the **buffer** of 100 bytes. Then overwrite the Return Address with the Starting address of **buffer**. So, when the **ret** instruction is executed, the control is transferred to the **code** in the **buffer**. As buffer contains the **exploit code** we want to execute, it gets executed without any problem.

*   This is what we saw did in the previous article:
    
        main ----------> vuln_func ----------> exploit_func (unrealistic function)
         ||                                         |
         ||                                         |
         |--------<----------------<-----------------
         |   
         |-------------SegFault
        

*   This is roughly what we will try to achive in this article:
    
        main -----------> vuln_func -----------> buffer(present in vuln_func)----------> run something cool!
        

But in what language do we write code into the buffer? Do we use C or assembly or what?

We have written C code, we have written assembly code. We are going one more level lower this time, to the lowest level we can get. We will be **writing / injecting** **machine code** directly into the buffer. Yes. We will be dealing with **0**s and **1**s from here.

Let us keep the BOF aside for a while and understand how do we inject and execute direct machine code.

# Executing machine code?

Let us take the following program:

    ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ cat code2.c
    #include<stdio.h>
    #include<string.h>
    #include<unistd.h>
    
    int main() {
    
            char buffer[100];
    
            read(0, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    
            void (*executeme)();
            executeme = buffer;
            executeme();
    
            return 0;
    }
    

*   The program is simple. It takes in whatever we type and executes it. It typecasts a **char** pointer into a **function pointer**. It executes whatever is present in the buffer.

*   Compile the program in the following manner:
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ gcc code2.c -o code2 -zexecstack
        code2.c: In function ‘main’:
        code2.c:11:12: warning: assignment from incompatible pointer type [-Wincompatible-pointer-types]
        executeme = buffer;
                    ^
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$
        

*   The first point to note is we compiled **code2.c** with this option **-zexecstack**. This allows execution of code present in stack. We will talk about this in detail in a future post.

## Execution: Round1

In this round of execution, we will just give some random strings and see how it gets executed or how the processor **tries** to execute it.

    ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ./code2
    asd
    Illegal instruction (core dumped)
    
    ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ./code2
    qwe
    Segmentation fault (core dumped)
    
    ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ./code2
    owihowiehfowiehf
    Segmentation fault (core dumped)
    
    ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ./code2
    qwerty
    Segmentation fault (core dumped)
    
    ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$
    

*   Look at this. They are all some random strings. The program crashed in each one of the cases.

*   It is important to understand what the processor is doing with these strings. The aim of this program is that whatever we input, that gets executed. But we still don't know what it means. What does it mean when we say that the whole input is getting executed?

## Analysis: Round1

Let us open up the executable with gdb and analyse what is going on.

        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ gdb -q code2
        Reading symbols from code2...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
        gdb-peda$ b main
        Breakpoint 1 at 0x40059a
        gdb-peda$ 
    

1.  Analysis of main function: 

*   This is the disassembly of the main function.
    
        gdb-peda$ disass main

        End of assembler dump.
        gdb-peda$
        

*   Construction of StackFrame:
    
        0x0000000000400596 <+0>:     push   rbp
        0x0000000000400597 <+1>:     mov    rbp,rsp
        0x000000000040059a <+4>:     add    rsp,0xffffffffffffff80
        
    
    *   Here, instead of **sub rsp, < ImmValue >**, there is **add rsp, < ImmValue >**. If you add a negative number to rsp, it is the same as subtracting a positive number from it. You can see that the number being added is **0xffffffffffffff80** which is a negative number. 

*   Calling the **read** function:
    
        0x00000000004005ab <+21>:    xor    eax,eax
        0x00000000004005ad <+23>:    lea    rax,[rbp-0x70]
        0x00000000004005b1 <+27>:    mov    edx,0x64
        0x00000000004005b6 <+32>:    mov    rsi,rax
        0x00000000004005b9 <+35>:    mov    edi,0x0
        0x00000000004005be <+40>:    call   0x400470 <read@plt>
        
    
    *   This function takes input from any given file. This is what the manpage has to say:
        
            NAME
            read - read from a file descriptor
            
            SYNOPSIS
            #include <unistd.h>
            
            ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
            
    
    *   **fd** is the File Descriptor. This is a unique number used to identify an open file. By default, **0** is the File Descriptor of Standard Input, **1** is the File Descriptor of Standard Output, **2** is the File Descriptor of Standard Error.
    
    *   Here, I want to read from Standard Input(or take in the User Input). So, The first argument is **0**. Register **rdi** has this value.
    
    *   Second Argument is the Address of the Buffer. The Address of **buffer** is **rbp-0x70**. Register **rsi** has this value.
    
    *   Third Argument is the number of bytes to take in. Obviously, we want to restrict it to the size of the buffer. Size of **buffer** is **100** bytes. So, **0x64** / **100** is loaded into Register **rdx**.
    
    *   Then **read** function is called.

*   Calling the Function using the Function Pointer **executeme**:
    
        0x00000000004005c3 <+45>:    lea    rax,[rbp-0x70]
        0x00000000004005c7 <+49>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x78],rax
        0x00000000004005cb <+53>:    mov    rdx,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x78]
        0x00000000004005cf <+57>:    mov    eax,0x0
        0x00000000004005d4 <+62>:    call   rdx
        
    
    *   We know that **rbp-0x70** is the Address of **buffer**.
    
    *   After instruction **<+53>** gets executed, **rdx** will have the Address of the buffer. **rbp-0x78** is the function pointer **executeme**. We had done this: **executeme = buffer**. That is what these 3 instructions are about.
    
    *   **executeme()** is equivalent to **call rdx** - the fifth instruction.
    
    *   Notice that typecasting is just the compiler doing everything. The processor doesn't know what typecasting is.

*   Now that we have a thorough understanding of what the **main** function does, let us go ahead and execute the program.

1.  Run the program!

*   Let us break at **0x00000000004005d4 <+62>: call rdx**. This is just before executing what we have entered.
    
        gdb-peda$ b *0x00000000004005d4

        gdb-peda$ continue
        Continuing.
        qwerty1234
        

*   I entered **qwerty1234**. The processor tries to execute it. We should understand what that means. Execute q? Execute w? Execute what?

*   This is the state just before **call rdx** :

*   Look at the **code** part. We had **qwerty1234\n** in the buffer. But here, we see some instructions. What are these? This requires some explanation.

*   Every assembly instruction has it's own representation at the machine code level. We have seen many instructions like **push rbp**, **mov rax, rbx** etc., Each one has it's own representation at the machine code level. This is what the assembler does. It converts **assembly instructions** to corresponding **machine code** - **0**s and **1**s.

*   So, **qwerty1234\n** is an array of **ascii** characters. Each ascii character has a corresponding **ascii value**. Let's have a look at this table:
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ascii -x

*   Ascii value of **q** is **0x71**, **w** is **0x77** etc.,

*   The processor doesn't care if it is ascii character **q** or **w** or **a** or anything. What it cares about it what they are stored as in the memory. Ascii value of each character is stored in the main memory. Let us use the **x/** command and confirm this:
    
        gdb-peda$ x/12xb 0x7fffffffda20
        0x7fffffffda20: 0x71    0x77    0x65    0x72    0x74    0x79    0x31    0x32
        0x7fffffffda28: 0x33    0x34    0x0a    0x00
        gdb-peda$ 
        

*   Processor sees it like this: **\x71\x77\x65\x72\x74\x79\x31\x32\x33\x34\x0a** .

*   Let us look at what instructions these 11 bytes represent:
    
        gdb-peda$ x/6i 0x7fffffffda20
        => 0x7fffffffda20:  jno    0x7fffffffda99
        0x7fffffffda22: gs jb  0x7fffffffda99
        0x7fffffffda25: jns    0x7fffffffda58
        0x7fffffffda27: xor    dh,BYTE PTR [rbx]
        0x7fffffffda29: xor    al,0xa
        0x7fffffffda2b: add    BYTE PTR [rax],al
        gdb-peda$ 
        
    
    *   The **i** in **x/6i** stands for **instruction**. I am asking gdb to display 6 instructions at the address 0x7fffffffda20.
    
    *   Look at these instructions. gdb has done the work of taking these 11 bytes, disassembling it and displaying it.
    
    *   There are 11 bytes. So, we have to consider bytes from 0x7fffffffda20 to 0x7fffffffda2a. Let us ignore the instruction at 0x7fffffffda2b.
    
    *   **qwerty1234\n** is disassembled into 5 **x64** instructions. And all these 5 instructions seem to be proper valid instructions. Honestly I did not know that **qwerty1234\n** represented valid instructions.

*   Let us take a closer look at these instructions and their machine code.
    
        gdb-peda$ x/i 0x7fffffffda20

        0x7fffffffda28: 0x33    0x34    0x0a
        
    
    *   Machine code of **jno 0x7fffffffda99** is **\x71\x77**.
    *   **gs jb 0x7fffffffda99** => **\x65\x72\x74**. 
    *   **jns 0x7fffffffda58** => **\x79\x31**. 
    *   **xor dh,BYTE PTR [rbx]** => **\x32\x33**. 
    *   **xor al,0xa** => **\x34\x0a**. 

*   I hope you have understood what executing a stream of bytes mean. For that matter, the **text segment** in an executable is just a stream of such bytes which gets executed.

*   Let us continue with our execution: **jno 0x7fffffffda99** was about to get executed.

*   **jno** stands for **Jump if Not Overflow(Signed)**. Let us not worry too much about this. Finally, this is a jump instruction which gets executed and this is the state:

*   And we hit a dead-end. The program crashed due to a Segmentation Fault.

The whole point of this analysis is to understand what execution of a bunch of bytes mean. I hope you have got some clarity over it.

Do the same analysis with different random inputs and reinforce your understanding.

We have to understand some concepts before we actually get into code injection.

# What is a system call?

Before we get into examples, we will understand a very important concept. We will understand what a System Call is.

Consider this. The only way to communicate with the processor and get work done is by using it's **Instruction Set**. It is a set of well-defined instructions which can be understood, interpreted and executed by the processor.

Now let us come to what an Operating System is. Operating System is a software which is in-between the machine / hardware and the user. It is a middleman which takes care of everything. Take a look at this diagram:

        -------------                                       -------------
        |           |                                       |           |
        | Processor |                                       |    OS     |
        |           |                                       | (Kernel)  |
        -------------                                       -------------
              |         
       Instruction Set
    

You can think of an Operating System as a Black Box which does a lot of Resource Management. There is a well-defined way to talk to a processor(Through the Instruction Set only). In the same way, there should be a well-defined way to talk to the Operating System also.

You might ask, why do you even need such a method to talk to the OS? A lot of reasons. As we mentioned above, an Operating System does all the Resource Management. What Resources are we talking about?

1.  Processor is itself a resource. There would be different processes running on one Operating System. Each one could belong to different users also. So, if there is no one to manage, the machine would go bonkers!

2.  RAM / Main Memory: In any machine, there is limited amount of main memory. My machine has 4GB of RAM. I should be able to manage everything in those 4GB. The OS does the management for us. We don't have to do anything.

3.  HardDisk: The Operating System has what are known as **FileSystems** which help in managing HardDisk.

4.  Peripheral Devices: This is what we use and see whenever we are on a computer. The Input Output devices. I am writing this article. And everytime I press a key on my keyboard, the Operating System is coming in, taking in what I type and sending it to the Monitor where I can see what I just typed. This is just one example. Suppose you are playing a multiplayer game. You are using your monitor to see the game, you are using the keyboard and mouse to control your character, your friends are all using joysticks. Look at this. Managing everything at once if definitely not an easy job.

Because of all this, the Operating System does all the Resource Management for us. To be able to use those resources, we have to **talk** in a very **specific** manner similar to a processor's Instruction Set.

The Operating System provides an **Interface** which we can use and request for resources. The Interface is a huge collection of **System Calls**. A System Call is a nothing but a Function Call inside an OS.

Consider this example. You want to display something on the monitor. You use a System Call used to write into something. If you want to read something from a file, you use a System Call which is designed to read from something. You want to use the speaker, you use a different System Call. So, this is how the previous diagram looks like for an OS:

                -------------
                |           |
                |    OS     |
                |           |
                -------------
                     |
              Set of System calls
    

Why did we even have to take a detour from our code injection and understand about System Calls? The reason is, injecting code to execute System Calls is easy and System Calls are very very powerful. They talk directly to the OS. Injecting code to execute some Library functions is hard, so we go for injecting machine code of System Calls.

The following is the Standard way to execute System Calls in 32-bit Intel Systems.

1.  Every System Call is identified by a unique number called the System Call Number. 
2.  A System call is a function call inside the OS. It is natural to have arguments. 
3.  Calling the System Call from **userspace** is a little different that the normal function calls. We **do not** use the **call** instruction because it is not a normal function call.

4.  SystemCall Number: eax

5.  Argument 0: ebx

6.  Argument 1: ecx

7.  Argument 2: edx

8.  Argument 3: esi

9.  Argument 4: edi

10. Argument 5: ebp

11. Return Value: eax

12. To execute the System Call, you use this instruction: **int 0x80**.

Do not worry much about the **int 0x80** instruction for now. It requires concepts of Operating Systems.

We can use this way to execute System Calls in 64-bit Intel Systems also. But there is a better, faster way designed for 64-bit systems which we will discuss in the next article.

This is where you can find a list of all System Calls for a 32-bit Intel System: **/usr/include/asm/unistd_32.h**. These are a few of them.

        #define __NR_restart_syscall 0
        #define __NR_exit 1
        #define __NR_fork 2
        #define __NR_read 3
        #define __NR_write 4
        #define __NR_open 5
        #define __NR_close 6
        #define __NR_waitpid 7
        #define __NR_creat 8
        #define __NR_link 9
        #define __NR_unlink 10
        #define __NR_execve 11
        #define __NR_chdir 12
        #define __NR_time 13
        #define __NR_mknod 14
        #define __NR_chmod 15
        #define __NR_lchown 16
        #define __NR_break 17
    

*   **NR** simply stands for **number**. **exit**'s System call number is 1. **read**'s number is 3. **write**'s number is 4 etc.,

*   For all the examples, refer to this file for the System Call number.

Let us start writing programs to understand all this better.

## Program 0

To start with, we take an assembly program with no body. Conside this program:

        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ cat none.asm 
        section .text
                global _start
    
        _start:
                jmp $
    

*   That **jmp $** will simply jump back to itself. The **$** represents the **current instruction**. So, it is an infinite loop. Let us assemble and link it to get the executable and execute it.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ nasm none.asm -f elf32
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ld none.o -o none
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ./none
        

*   You get nothing. It is a program stuck in an infinite loop.

*   Let us use a wonderful program called **strace** and see what **System Calls** are executed by our program. The **s** in strace stands for **S**ystem Call.

*   This is what I got after running with strace.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ strace ./none
        execve("./none", ["./none"], [/* 81 vars */]) = 0
        

*   The **execve** is a System Call executed when you have a new program to run. The **shell** executes this System Call to **run** our program **none**. This System Call is **not** executed by our program **none**. So, it can be ignored.

*   This was expected because the body of our program was almost nothing.

## Program 1

Let us take up our first System call **exit**. Consider this equivalent C function for this:

        man _exit
    
        _EXIT(2)                         Linux Programmer's Manual                        _EXIT(2)
    
        NAME
        _exit, _Exit - terminate the calling process
    
        SYNOPSIS
        #include <unistd.h>
    
        void _exit(int status);
    
        #include <stdlib.h>
    
        void _Exit(int status);
    

*   So, it takes **1** argument - the status. Do not get confused with C library's **_exit** and the **exit** System call. They are Different.

*   Let us execute **exit(1)**. Consider this assembly program:
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ cat exit.asm 
        section .text
                global _start
        
        _start:
        
                mov eax, 0x01
                mov ebx, 0x01
                int 0x80
        

*   **eax** is loaded with **1** - The System Call Number.

*   **ebx** is the Argument 0 - **1** here.

*   **int 0x80** to execute the System Call.

*   Let us assemble and link the program to get the executable.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ nasm exit.asm -f elf32
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ld exit.o -o exit
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ./exit
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$
        

*   You observe nothing because the program is just terminated because the **exit** System Call.

*   Let us observe using **strace**.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ strace ./exit
        execve("./exit", ["exit"], [/* 81 vars */]) = 0
        strace: [ Process PID=5586 runs in 32 bit mode. ]
        exit(1)                                 = ?
        +++ exited with 1 +++
        

*   As expected. The **exit** System Call is executed.

## Program 2

Let us execute the **write** System Call. Let write a Hello World program. Consider this:

        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ cat hello.asm
        section .data
    
        str: db "Hello World", 0x0a, 0x00
    
        section .text
                global _start
    
        _start:
                mov eax, 0x04
                mov ebx, 0x01
                mov ecx, str
                mov edx, 13
                int 0x80
    
                mov eax, 0x01
                mov ebx, 0x00
                int 0x80
    

*   The program is very simple. Consider the first part:
    
        mov eax, 0x04
        mov ebx, 0x01
        mov ecx, str
        mov edx, 13
        int 0x80
        

*   **4** is the System Call number of **write**.

*   File Descriptor of Standard Output is **1** which is Argument 0.

*   Argument 1 is the Address of buffer. Here it is the string **str**. It is loaded to **ecx**.

*   Argument 2 is the number of bytes that should be written. Here, we want all **13** bytes to be written to Standard Output.

*   The second part is the **exit** System Call with Argument **0**.

*   Let us get the executable and run it.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ nasm hello.asm -f elf32
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ld hello.o -o hello -m elf_i386
        
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ./hello
        Hello World
        
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ strace ./hello
        execve("./hello", ["hello"], [/* 81 vars */]) = 0
        strace: [ Process PID=5777 runs in 32 bit mode. ]
        write(1, "Hello World\n\0", 13Hello World
        )         = 13
        exit(0)                                 = ?
        +++ exited with 0 +++
        

*   First the **write** System Call is executed. Then **exit** is executed.

## Program 3

Now that we have seen 2 simple System Calls, let us explore a System Call which is very helpful in Code Injection.

It is the **execve** System Call. Let us look at the manpage.

        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ man execve
        NAME
        execve - execute program
    
        SYNOPSIS
        #include <unistd.h>
    
        int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[],
                        char *const envp[]);
    

*   The **execve** System Call executes a new program.

*   Let us write a C program first, then the assembly program.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ cat execve.c
        #include<unistd.h>
        
        int main() {
        
                execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL);
                return 0;
        }
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ gcc execve.c -o execve -m32
        execve.c: In function ‘main’:
        execve.c:5:2: warning: null argument where non-null required (argument 2) [-Wnonnull]
        execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL);
         ^
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ 
        

*   Ignore the warning.

*   Let us execute it.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ./execve 
        $ 
        $ 
        $ ls
        code1    code2.c   exit      exploit.txt  hello.o   none.o
        code1.c  execve    exit.asm  hello    none      peda-session-code2.txt
        code2    execve.c  exit.o    hello.asm    none.asm  post.md
        $ 
        

*   So, we have the **/bin/sh** executed. You can see it. Try and play around with the new shell. You will find a lot of differences between a normal shell and this.

*   Now that the C program is done, let us jump into the assembly program.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ cat execve.asm 
        section .data
        
        str: db 0x2f, "bin", 0x2f, "sh", 0x00
        
        section .text
                global _start
        
        _start:
                mov eax, 11
                mov ebx, str
                mov ecx, 0x00
                mov edx, 0x00
                int 0x80
        
                mov eax, 0x01
                mov ebx, 0x00
                int 0x80
        

*   The first part is the **execve** System Call. System Call Number is **11**. The arguments are very similar to the C program.

*   Let go ahead, assemble it, link it and execute it.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ nasm execve.asm -f elf32
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ld execve.o -o execve_asm_32 -m elf_i386
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ./execve_asm_32 
        $ 
        $
        

*   Bingo! It worked.

Best way to get hold of what System Calls do is by writing C programs and their corresponding assembly programs.

So, that was a really quick introduction to System Calls and how they are executed.

# Back to code injection!

We had to understand what System Calls are because we will be injecting code which execute System Calls. Without knowing what a System Call is, it wouldn't be very good to go ahead.

Ok. Let us start by injecting very simple machine code.

## Injection 1

Let us inject the code **none.asm**. As we saw, we cannot inject assembly code. We have to inject direct machine code in the form of an array of **hexadecimal** values.

Let us get the machine code of the instruction **jmp $**. We can get it using **objdump** on **none**.

        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ objdump -Mintel -d none
    
        none:     file format elf32-i386
    
    
        Disassembly of section .text:
    
        08048060 <_start>:
        8048060:    eb fe                   jmp    8048060 <_start>
    

*   The Machine code is **\xeb\xfe**.

*   Let us get back to this program:
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ cat code2.c
        #include<stdio.h>
        #include<string.h>
        #include<unistd.h>
        
        int main() {
        
                char buffer[100];
        
                read(0, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
        
                void (*executeme)();
                executeme = buffer;
                executeme();
        
                return 0;
        }
        

*   This is how we can run it:
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ python -c "print '\xeb\xfe'" | ./code2
        

*   And the program is stuck like the way **none** got stuck. We cannot believe it until we confirm it.

*   Let us run it using gdb and confirm.

*   Put the code to be injected into a file.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ python -c "print '\xeb\xfe'" > none.exploit.txt
        

*   This is the Disassembly of main function of **code2** :
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ gdb -q code2
        Reading symbols from code2...(no debugging symbols found)...done.

*   Bingo! That is exactly what we wanted. Jump to the current instruction.

*   Congratulate yourself on this!! It a successful code injection.

The obvious question is, can we do better?

## Injection 2

Let us inject **exit(1)** code.

*   First of all, let us get the machine code using **objdump**.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ objdump -Mintel -d exit
        
        exit:     file format elf32-i386
        
        
        Disassembly of section .text:
        
        08048060 <_start>:
        8048060:    b8 01 00 00 00          mov    eax,0x1
        8048065:    bb 01 00 00 00          mov    ebx,0x1
        804806a:    cd 80                   int    0x80
        

*   So, the machine code is **\xb8\x01\x00\x00\x00\xbb\x01\x00\x00\x00\xcd\x80**.

*   Let us inject it and see what happens.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ python -c "print '\xb8\x01\x00\x00\x00\xbb\x01\x00\x00\x00\xcd\x80'" | ./code2
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$
        

*   Let us confirm by running it with gdb.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ python -c "print '\xb8\x01\x00\x00\x00\xbb\x01\x00\x00\x00\xcd\x80'" > exit.exploit.txt

*   This looks good. We can see the assembly code we have written. So, it is confirmed that **exit** System Call is executed.

There is a very important thing to talk about at this point:

The machine code of **exit** system call has **NULL** characters in it. It has many **\x00** in it. In the program **code2**, we are using **read** to take input. Suppose we have a software where **strcpy** is used to copy the user input into the buffer. The **strcpy** function is programmed to copy everything from source till it encounters a **NULL** character. So, instead of **\xb8\x01\x00\x00\x00\xbb\x01\x00\x00\x00\xcd\x80** getting copied completely, only **\xb8\x01** is copied. You can check this out by writing a program.

So, from now on, we have to write assembly code which gets converted to machine code without any **0** NULL characters. There should not be even a single NULL character in the machine code which we inject. This might be a bit harder but our **exploits** becomes more **reliable** because it is protected against functions which behave differently when they encounter NULL characters.

With that said, let us try to write assembly code for **exit(1)** System Call without **\x00**s. Take this as an exercise and figure this out.

The following is one way to do it:

        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ cat exit_no_null.asm 
        section .text
                global _start
    
        _start:
    
                xor eax, eax
                add al, 1
                xor ebx, ebx
                add bl, 1
                int 0x80
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ nasm exit_no_null.asm -f elf32
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ld exit_no_null.o -o exit_no_null -m elf_i386
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ./exit_no_null 
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ 
    

*   Let us take a look at objdump's output:
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ objdump -Mintel -d exit_no_null
        
        exit_no_null:     file format elf32-i386
        
        
        Disassembly of section .text:
        
        08048060 <_start>:
        8048060:    31 c0                   xor    eax,eax
        8048062:    04 01                   add    al,0x1
        8048064:    31 db                   xor    ebx,ebx
        8048066:    80 c3 01                add    bl,0x1
        8048069:    cd 80                   int    0x80     
        

*   So, our machine code would be **\x31\xc0\x04\x01\x31\xdb\x80\xc3\x01\xcd\x80**.

*   Let us go ahead and test it with **code2** program.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ python -c "print '\x31\xc0\x04\x01\x31\xdb\x80\xc3\x01\xcd\x80'" | ./code2
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$      
        

*   Confirm once with gdb also.

# Summary

We discussed a lot of things today.

1.  Our main goal was to understand what **Code Injection** is. 
2.  We started with some a program which executes whatever we input. So, we saw what it means to execute direct machine code. 
3.  Took a small detour and saw what a System Call is. I felt this is very important to understand before going forward. 
4.  Introduction to Code Injection - We saw how **raw machine code** can be injected into a buffer and it can be executed. 
5.  Importance of **not** having NULL characters in machine code we generate. 

We wrote assembly code which gave meaning machine code. We did inject it, but nothing exciting happened. In this article, we made sure we understood the concepts properly. In the next article, we will see how we can write complex exploits, abuse the vulnerable software to get real work done and more.

# A few interesting things!

**1**. Library Functions and System Calls ?

We have written so many programs so far, but we never specifically mentioned the use of system calls. When we write programs, we mostly use C / C++ Library functions to get the job done. There is something you have to understand. The Library functions will **internally** use System Calls to make things happen.

Consider the **printf** function It prints a string in the Standard Output. Writing on the Standard Output is writing stuff on the Monitor. That is, our program is requesting to use some Hardware. And who manages all the Hardware Resources? The Operating System. So, there should be a very specific System Call to do this. Consider this :

        char str[] = "This is a string";
        int x = 100;
        char c = 'a';
    
        printf("x = %d, c = %c, str = %s\n", x, c, str);
    

*   There are 3 variables here and there are format specifiers used in the printf statement.

*   Now, let us see the **write** System Call:
    
        NAME
        write - write to a file descriptor
        
        SYNOPSIS
        #include <unistd.h>
        
         ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);     
        
    
    *   This **write** is also a C function. This is a **wrapper** to the actual System Call. We will see what a wrapper is in a while.
    
    *   The System Call is simple and straight forward. It takes only 3 arguments - which are the only 3 things required to write something.
    
    *   Argument0: Where to write - File Descriptor of the file.
    
    *   Argument1: What to write - The Address of Buffer which has the contents to be written.
    
    *   Argument2: How much to write - Number of bytes to write from Buffer.
    
    *   It is simple and minimalistic.

*   But our printf is fancy. it supports different Data Types - integers, strings, characters etc., The write System call is not aware of any of that. It just writes **bytes** in a specific location.

*   What the **printf** Library function does it take those 4 arguments(in the example), and create a **buffer** with whatever we want to print on the screen.

*   The Format String = "x = %d, c = %c, str = %s\n"

*   What we actually want to print is this: "x = 100, c = a, str = This is a string\n";

*   The **printf** function takes the Format String and the corresponding arguments and gives the above **string** which we want to print on Standard Output.

*   To confirm this, you can write a program which uses printf and check it using **strace**. You will see the use of a **write** System Call.

*   Similarly, **scanf**. The System Call used to take input is **read**. But **scanf** allows us to specify formats - much like printf. Even **scanf** uses **read** System Call.

**2**. Strange observation while writing assembly code:

*   In one of the examples of generating machine code, we put a constraint to have **no** NULL characters in it. So, for **exit(1)** this is the code I have used here:
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ objdump -Mintel -d exit_no_null
        
        exit_no_null:     file format elf32-i386
        
        
        Disassembly of section .text:
        
        08048060 <_start>:
        8048060:    31 c0                   xor    eax,eax
        8048062:    04 01                   add    al,0x1
        8048064:    31 db                   xor    ebx,ebx
        8048066:    80 c3 01                add    bl,0x1
        8048069:    cd 80                   int    0x80
        

*   This worked perfectly fine. But this was not what I came up with when we discussed about having no NULL characters. I first came up with the following assembly program:
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ objdump -Mintel -d exit_no_null_faulty
        
        exit_no_null_faulty:     file format elf32-i386
        
        
        Disassembly of section .text:
        
        08048060 <_start>:
        8048060:    31 c0                   xor    eax,eax
        8048062:    40                      inc    eax
        8048063:    31 db                   xor    ebx,ebx
        8048065:    43                      inc    ebx
        8048066:    cd 80                   int    0x80
        
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ nasm exit_no_null_faulty.asm -f elf32
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ld exit_no_null_faulty.o -o exit_no_null_faulty -m elf_i386
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ ./exit_no_null_faulty 
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$
        

*   Perfect. The program as such is working fine. Then, even if I inject it, it should work fine. Let us inject and see what happens.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_9$ python -c "print '\x31\xc0\x40\x31\xdb\x43\xcd\x80'" | ./code2
        Segmentation fault (core dumped)
        

*   That is very very strange. There is no problem with **code2**. We have checked it several times and have run it with few other examples also. I was almost sure that something is wrong with the code we have injected. But everything looks fine here. I wanted to see what the problem is.

*   The following is how the processor is interpretting the machine code we injected :
    
        [-------------------------------------code-------------------------------------]
        => 0x7fffffffda20:  xor    eax,eax
        0x7fffffffda22: rex xor ebx,ebx
        0x7fffffffda25: rex.XB int 0x80
        0x7fffffffda28: or     al,BYTE PTR [rax]
        

*   This is unbelievable. There are no **inc** instructions at all. There are **rex** prefix added to **xor ebx, ebx** and **int 0x80**. So, this is where the problem is.

*   This is why I did not give this version of **exit(1)** when we were discussing because it would disrupt the flow.

*   I was always under this belief that every Assembly Instruction has a unique Machine Code representation. That is, there is a **one-one** mapping between an Assembly Instruction and it's Machine Code Representation. But this example made me rethink about this.

*   And yes. Assembly Instructions and Machine Code Representation are **not** in a **one-one** relationship. I also found this amazing DEFCON talk to back this observation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eunYrrcxXfw .

*   It is important to be cautious and expect such things.

**3**. Enabling the randomizing security feature!

We had disabled it. It is important to enable it.

        # echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space 
        # 
    

Now, your machine is safer.

With that, I will end this article. I learnt a hell lot of stuff while writing this article. I hope even you learn something out of this.

Thank you!
