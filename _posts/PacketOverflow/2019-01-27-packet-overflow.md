Hello all!

**Packet Overflow!** is a new series of articles I am starting to understand Computer Networks better. 

In this series, we are going to have fun playing around with packets, capturing them, dissecting and analyzing them, understanding the different Networking Protocols used. It is going to be a hands-on series with a bit of theory. 

We will be doing 3 things very frequently in this series. 

1. Writing simple network programs
2. Capturing packets using a tool like Wireshark which will help us analyze them. 
3. Read RFCs(Request For Comments) to understand the protocol better. 

Let us start with covering some important pre-requisites. 

In the first few posts, I will be introducing Network Programming and Introduction to  Wireshark. Once it is done, we are ready to start our journey with packets!

Stay tuned!

Thank you for reading :)
