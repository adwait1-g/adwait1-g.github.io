Hello All!

I recently moved my blog from WordPress to GitHub Pages. I thought it would be difficult shifting everything from one place to another. But everything happened in 1 single day. It was really easy to do it. 

So, I would like to share what I did to migrate the complete site from WordPress to GitHub Pages.

The complete content has been divided into 2 posts. In the first post, I will be discussing how to create a website using Jekyll from creating a GitHub Repository till a working website. Along with that, I will also share the things I did while migrating from WordPress to GitHub Pages. 

No blog is complete without the comments section. So, in the [second post](/blogging/2018/11/27/setting-up-a-blog-using-jekyll-Part2.html), I will write how I used [disqus](https://disqus.com/) to power my blog with the comments section. 

With content and comments, your blog is good to go!

Let us get started!

**Pre-requisites** :

1. You will need a GitHub Account - to use GitHub Pages. 
2. How to use **git**, the famous Version Control System. 

## Step1: Creating a repository in your GitHub Account. 

In case you do not have a GitHub account, it is very easy to create one. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) , press the **Sign up** button and create one. 

1. First step is to create a **new** Repository with name **< username >.github.io** . For example, my GitHub Username is **adwait1-g**. So, I created a repository with the name **adwait1-g.github.io**. The repository name must be of the form **< username >.github.io** and nothing else. If it is something else, your website won't work.

2. Once you have created a repository, click on the **Clone or download** Button and copy the link present there. For my repository, the link is "https://github.com/adwait1-G/adwait1-g.github.io.git", you will have something similar. 

3. Fire up your terminal and execute the following command. 

        $ git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
    
    * Don't forget to replace **username** with your actual GitHub username. 
    * What you did there is, you downloaded a copy of your online repository onto your local machine. **clone** means **duplicate** or create one more of the same kind. So, you have the same repository on your local machine. 
    * The repository will be a **directory** with name **username.github.io**.   

4. Enter the directory **username.github.io** with this command. 

        $ cd username.github.io

    * This is probably empty or will have a README.md file. 

At this point, **Step1** is done. 


## Step2: Using Jekyll to generate a sample website. 

All the code, your content, everything required to make your website come alive will be stored in this Repository. So, make sure you are inside this directory for this step. 

Jekyll is a **static website generator**. In simple words, you write your posts in Markdown and Jekyll will take everything and give a proper website. It does not have any backend database. Everything are simply markdown files. For complete details, look at the [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/)

1. Installing Jekyll. 
    
    * Jekyll is a Ruby Framework. So, you will need the **Ruby** interpreter to run it. This is how you install Ruby. 

            $ sudo apt-get install ruby
    
    * Then execute these 2 commands: 

            $ gem install bundler jekyll
    
    * With that, you have **jekyll** installed on your machine. 

2. Let us build a sample website using jekyll. Run the following command. 

        username.github.io$ jekyll new .

    * The above command will generate all files required to run a simple website and store it in your directory.  
    * The general command is **jekyll new < website_name >** . So, Jekyll creates a directory with name **website_name** and lays down all the files in that directory. 
    * In our case, we already are inside the directory, so we used **.** instead of **website_name**. The **.**(dot) means **current directory**. 
    * You will get an output like this: 

                username.github.io$ jekyll new .
                Running bundle install in /username.github.io...  Bundler: The dependency tzinfo-data (>= 0) will be unused by any of the platforms Bundler is installing for. Bundler is installing for ruby but the dependency is only for x86-mingw32, x86-mswin32, x64-mingw32, java. To add those platforms to the bundle, run `bundle lock --add-platform x86-mingw32 x86-mswin32 x64-mingw32 java`.

                Bundler: Use `bundle info [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
                New jekyll site installed in /username.github.io.
                /username.github.io$

3. Let us run the Jekyll server and look at our sample website. 

        username.github.io$ jekyll serve

    * This is the kind of output you would get. 

        username.github.io$ jekyll serve
        Configuration file: /username.github.io/_config.yml
                    Source: /username.github.io
            Destination: /username.github.io/_site
        Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
            Generating...
            Jekyll Feed: Generating feed for posts
                            done in 0.34 seconds.
        Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/username.github.io'
            Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
        Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
    
    * Note the **Server address**. Copy that Server Address. 

4. Open up your browser and paste that Server Address and Enter. You should be able to see an output like this: 

    ![jekyll_sample_website](/assets/2018-11-27-setting-up-a-blog-using-jekyll-:-Part1/jekyll_sample_website.png)


5. With this, you have a working website running!


From here, it will be changing this Website the way we want and get our blog ready. 

## Step3: Understanding the structure of the website 

It would be helpful if we understand the bunch of files generated by Jekyll because it will help us to modify the required files / directories to convert the sample website into the site we want.  

1. This is what the **username.github.io** directory has. 

        username.github.io$ ls
        404.html  about.md  _config.yml  Gemfile  Gemfile.lock  index.md  _posts  _site

    * The **_config.yml** has details about your website. It has **title**, **email**, **github_username** etc., 
    * The **404.html** page is the webpage that gets displayed when someone asks for something which is not present in your site. 
    * The **index.md** is the **home page** of your website. 
    * Look at the sample website again. There is a **About** hyperlink which will lead you to a webpage. That webpage is designed in **about.md**. This is just the sample. If you look at my website, it has other things like Categories, About Me etc., We can have the options we want. 
    * The **Gemfile** has a list of all **gems** being used by your website. A **gem** is a Library written in Ruby which can directly be used. 
    * You can place your blog articles in the **_posts** directory. Every article should be written in **Markdown**. Jekyll will generate the corresponding **html** files. 
    * Finally the **_site**. This is actually the website. Look at what it has. 

            username.github.io/_site$ ls
            404.html  about  assets  feed.xml  index.html  jekyll

    * The **_site** directory has all the corresponding **html** files of the **markdown** files we saw. 

This is the File Structure of a Jekyll Sample website. 

## Step4: Convert the sample website into your website

In this step, you will customize the site the way you want. There are so many things you can do. I will list and explain the things I did to get my blog running. 

1. First thing I did is update the **_config.yml** file. Fill in the details there properly because they will get displayed in your website. 

    * **title**: The title of your website. Eg: My blog's name is **PWNTHEBOX!**.
    * **email**: Enter your Email Id. It will be displayed in every page of your website. Look at the bottom of my website. You will find my Email Address. 
    * **description**: You can write anything here. Describe your website in a few words. 
    *  **github_username**, **twitter_username** - You know it. You can also have a **LinkedIn** Username. Add it like this: **linkedin_username:**. 
    

2. Add the required **header** pages. 

    * The **about.md** is a header page. Similarly, you can have any number of Header pages you want. My site has 4 header pages at this point in time. I did not need the **about.md**. So, I removed it. I added 4 Header pages / Markdown files I needed. They are **categories.md** for Categories, **awesome_resources.md** for Awesome Resources!, **about_me.md** for About Me! and **about_this_site.md** for About This Site!. These are pages I needed. You can add pages you need. 

    * Once you have placed the **markdown** files of required header files, execute **jekyll serve** and make sure you get the Header options. 

    * In my site, the order of Header options is Categories, Awesome Resources!, About This Site! and About Me!. You can specify the order you want in the **_config.yml** file. Look at the following section of **_config.yml** of my site.   

            plugins:
                - jekyll-feed


            header_pages:
                - categories.md
                - awesome_resources.md
                - about_this_site.md
                - about_me.md
    
        * You add a heading called **header_pages:** in the **_config.yml** and specify your order. 

    * After doing all this, verify the site by executing **jekyll serve** . 

3. Adding the posts you want - Follow these simple rules and you are good to go. 

    * Every post / article should be in the **markdown** format. If you do not know markdown format, do not worry at all. Look at this [page](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). It has the basic syntax which is all you will need. If you need more, you can always google. 

    * **For people who are migrating from WordPress to GitHub Pages**: The default text editor in WordPress is not a Markdown Editor. It is a normal Editor. So, in case you have all your blog posts in normal text format, then you will mostly have to rewrite it to markdown or find a way to convert it. I did not face this problem because I was really comfortable with writing posts using markdown, I had downloaded a Markdown Editor for WordPress. So, I had to literally copy-paste files from there to here. 

    * In Jekyll, every post has a particular naming format. It goes like this: 

            yyyy-mm-dd-the-title-of-the-post.md
    
        * The Date is very important. 
    
    * Inside the post, there is something called as **Front Matter** which is a must for any post. Look at the Front Matter of this post. 

            ---
            layout: post
            title: Setting up a Blog using Jekyll - Part1
            categories: Blogging
            comments: true
            ---
    * Here, the **layout: post** is the most important thing. You **cannot** skip it. To know what happens if you skip it, skip it for a post, do jekyll serve and see. 
    * In the **filename** of the post itself, you would have added the name of the post. In case if you do not add the **title:** option here, Jekyll will extract the post title from the filename. I personally feel it is always better to add the **title:** option and be sure about the post title. 
    * Yes. You can add **categories** too. It depends on the post. This article which I am writing is about Blogging, so is the category. There are no standard categories. You can categorize the post the way you want. 
    * The **comments** option. For now, keep it as true. But nothing will happen - you will not have a comments section just because of this option being true. I will talk about comments in detail in the next post. 
    * Last but the most important, the **---** at the beginning and ending is a must. If that is not there, the website will not function properly. 

Place the Markdown file in the **_posts** directory and execute **jekyll serve**. You will see that post's link on your website's homepage. Like this, you can write as many posts as you want. 

At this point, you can pretty much design the whole website the way you want. I did not talk about the themes in Jekyll. The default theme is **minima**. I felt it is simple and beautiful, so I did not change it. If you want to change the theme, look at this [page](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-jekyll-theme-to-your-github-pages-site/). It has clear cut instructions of how to do it. 


## Step5: Commiting changes and pushing the website code to your GitHub

You would have made a lot of changes like added a bunch of blog posts, added a few header pages you want, modified the _config.yml file etc., When you do **jekyll serve**, all these changes are see. If you want see the same in the browser when your site is hosted in the Internet, you have to push the code in the **username.github.io** directory to the online Repository of your GitHub account. Follow these steps and you will be done. 

1. Add all your files to the **staging area**. 

    * Remember how the **username.github.io** directory was at the beginning of this post. It was empty or maximum had a README.md file. But now, you have all files required to make the website running. So, add all these files into git's staging area with the following command. 

            username.github.io$ git add .
    
    * This command means, add all files in the **present directory**(**.**) to the staging area. 

2. Commit the changes.

    * Once you added the files to the staging area, you have to commit those changes. This is how you do it. 

            username.github.io$ git commit -m "Your commit message"
    
    * Your commit message can be anything. Just make sure it is meaningful and tells something about the changes you have done. 

3. Push the code to your online repository. 

    * You have made changes in your local directory and commited them. The only thing left is to push those files to your online repository where all the magic happens. Execute the following command. 

            username.github.io$ git push origin master
            Username for 'https://github.com': username
            Password for 'https://username@github.com':

    * Once this is done, your online repository is updated. 

4. Give a few seconds. Open up the browser and enter the URL: **username.github.io**. You should be able to see your site!! 

A hearty congratulations on this. You have your site ready and running!


## Step6: Use a custom domain for your website(Optional Step)

This is an optional step. If you want to use a custom domain for your website instead of username.github.io, you may follow the following steps to get this done. What I mean by custom domain is, the actual URL of my website given by github is **adwait1-g.github.io**. But, I wanted **www.pwnthebox.net** to be the URL of my website.So, www.pwnthebox.net is the custom URL. 

You will have to buy such a domain from a Domain markerplace like GoDaddy, AWS's Route 53 or any such place.

Consider a domain **mydomain.xyz**. Suppose you want to keep your website URL as **www.mydomain.xyz**. 

1. In the directory **username.github.io**, execute the following command. 

        username.github.io$ echo "www.mydomain.xyz" > CNAME

    * Here, you are creating a file with name **CNAME** and adding the desired URL in it. 
    * **CNAME** stands for **Canonical Name**. You will know what it means in the next step. 
    * Once this is done, add this to the staging area, commit changes and push it to your GitHub Repository. 

2. Go to the place where you bought that domain and create a DNS Record which should look like the following. 

        www.mydomain.xyz CNAME username.github.io
    

After a few seconds, you can see the change. You can type in the URL **www.mydomain.xyz** and you will see your website. 


## Step7: Enabling TLS in your website

You can test this. When the URL is username.github.io, your website has TLS - **https**. When you use your custom URL, it will just be **http**. To make the site **https** follow these steps. 

1. Login to your GitHub account and choose the repository **username.github.io**. 

2. Go to **Settings**. Look at this screenshot: 

    ![Settings_in_my_repository](/assets/2018-11-27-setting-up-a-blog-using-jekyll-:-Part1/Settings_in_my_repository.png)

3. In the Settings, there a lot of options. As you scroll down, you will a section named as **GitHub Pages**. Look at this screenshot: 

    ![enforce_https](/assets/2018-11-27-setting-up-a-blog-using-jekyll-:-Part1/enforce_https.png)

    * Look at that option **Enforce HTTPS**. Click on that box and make sure **Enforce HTTPS** is true - that box should have a tick mark.

Once the last step is done, your website is always TLS enabled. 


There is just 2 last things I want to share with you. 

1. Any post you write might have images, link to some files etc., So, you can store it this way: 

    * In your root directory(**username.github.io**), create a directory of the name **assets**. 

            username.github.io$ mkdir assets
    
    * This directory is where all the **assets** of a post like images, files etc., are stored. Suppose you wrote a post with name **yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-the-post.md**. Suppose you have a few images and files you want to use in that post. You can store those images, files etc., in the following way. 

        * Inside the **assets** directory, create a directory with the same name as that of the post. 

            username.github.io/assets$ mkdir yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-the-post
        
        * Enter that directory and store all those images and files or anything related to that post. 
    
    * You can use an image of name **name_of_image.png** in the post like this: 

            ![name_of_image](/assets/yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-the-post/name_of_image.png)    
        
    * If it a file with name **name_of_file.xyz**, you can do this: 

            [name_of_file.xyz](/assets/yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-the-post/name_of_file.xyz)


2. At any cost, do not store anything manually in the **_site** directory. This is because Jekyll generates the content in the **_site** directory using everything else in the **username.github.io** directory. As Jekyll generates it, anything you store will be removed from it. So, whatever you want to store, it should be stored outside the **_site** directory. 
    

At this point, you will have a website running. 

In the next post, We will see how we can make our website more effective by enabling comments section for each post using [disqus](https://disqus.com). 

At any point, if you get stuck at any step discussed above, feel free to look at my [repository](https://github.com/adwait1-G/adwait1-g.github.io). 

That is it for this post. I hope you were able to create a website using jekyll.

Thank you!
