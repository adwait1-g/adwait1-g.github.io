Off-late (10 March 2025), I have been reading about and working on the concept of Physical Internet. It is an alternate paradigm of logistics network inspired from the Digital Internet. As part of that, I come across lot of interesting books, papers, articles etc., on PI and related stuff. I will be putting all of them here.

## 1. PI, Transportation and Logistics
