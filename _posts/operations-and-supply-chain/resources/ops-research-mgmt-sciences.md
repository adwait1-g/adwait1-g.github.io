When it comes to OR/DS/QM, you can say I am a wanna-be. The stuff I had learnt (Graph Theory, Optimization, Transportation problems etc.,) are all very pertinent to the field but its all very rusty in my mind given it was a while ago I studied them. And today AI-ML is also included here which I have no clue about. So I plan to brush up on the old stuff I had learnt and learn atleast the simple stuff in AI-ML. Partly why I took up a Big Data Analytics specialization.

# 1. Books

1. [Introduction to Operations Research, by Hillier and Lieberman](https://archive.org/details/introduction-to-operations-research): The go-to book management students refer to when they want to get a taste of Operations Research. One tip if you plan to read it: I tried to read it the traditional way - where I start from page 1 and wanted to go till the end. It wasn't really a good idea. In this book, each chapter is a huge topic in itself. For example, just reading the chapter of Queuing Theory was not pleasurous. I generally used to explore various industries which will incorporate one or more of these concepts in it, and then I would read just the relevant chapter - I started using it as a reference book than a course textbook. For example, one big part of aviation is route scheduling and to get a good understanding of it, I had to get hold of the transportation problems, network optimization - so I read these chapters, to understand Passenger Flows in Airport Operations, knowing queuing theory was necessary, so I ended up reading it. You might be able to read the book in one go, but in case you are not able to, try out this method.
2. [Introduction to Management Science: A modeling and case studies approach with spreadsheets, by Hillier and Hillier](https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780070599680): A book written by the Hillier Father-Son duo. Same with the previous book, I did not "finish" this book in one go. Just read the concepts and did the excel problems when I encountered the relevant concept. A great book if you want to focus mainly on modeling problems and solving them on Excel (than get into the crazy mathematics behind it).
3. [Introduction to Queuing Theory, by Robert Cooper](https://www.cse.fau.edu/~bob/publications/IntroToQueueingTheory_Cooper.pdf)
4. [Basic Queuing Theory](https://yzr95924.github.io/pdf/book/Basic-Queueing-Theory.pdf)
5. [Machine Learning - A Probabilistic Perspective, by Kevin P. Murphy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerasking/book-1/master/ML%20Machine%20Learning-A%20Probabilistic%20Perspective.pdf): A book my professor suggested for better understanding ML
6. [Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning, by Miguel Morales](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-reinforcement-learning): Honestly the only book in this section I have braved to open and understand first few chapters well. Even though I don't have a mathematical understanding of (D)RL as of now, I have a hunch that it is well-suited for many problems in Supply Chain Management and overall the field of Operations in general. Which is why I want to get my understanding right when it comes to (D)RL. Book available on libgen.
7. [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, by Robert S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf)
8. [Regression Analysis: A Practical Introduction](https://pdfcoffee.com/regression-analysis-a-practical-introduction-pdf-free.html)
