title: Resources on Aviation Management and Airport Operations

This is one field that I find absolutely fascinating these days. In its operations (be it an airline or an airport), it has every type of management problem and I think each facet of its operations is its own field of research.

## 1. Books

1. [Airline Operations and Management: A Management Textbook](https://archive.org/details/airline-operations-and-management-a-management-textbook-pdfdrive_202105): A great book that introduces the subject of Airline Management (only tactical management, not strategic) from a managerial perspective. It is heavy on concepts and jargon, a great introductory book. The manager in me got very excited reading this book. The latest edition of this book is available on libgen.
2. [Airline Operations and Scheduling](https://ftp.idu.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/ebook/ip/BUKU%20SCHEDULING/Airline%20Operations%20and%20Scheduling.pdf): A great book if one wants to dive into the world of modeling various aviation management problems, solve them using excel and get a taste of application of operations research in aviation. The author makes it clear that the book is a bridge between the theory and the actual mathematical research that happens on aviation (which is highly technical and regular management students may miss out on it). The Author, [Prof. Massoud Bazargan](https://faculty.erau.edu/Massoud.Bazargan) is an expert in the field, he is broadly into Operations Research and Decision Sciences and using them to solve problems in various fields, looking at his page. Give it a try if you want to get a glimpse of how things are modeled and how things are made to work.
3. [Airport Operations, by Norman Ashford](http://repo.poltekbangsby.ac.id/id/eprint/581/1/Airport%20Operations,%203%20edition%20(%20PDFDrive%20).pdf): I have read parts of the book necessary for my research (chapters on Passenger Flows, Cargo Operations and Airline Scheduling to be precise), I found it to more than an introductory book.
4. [The Global Airline Industry, by Prof. Peter Belobaba](http://komaristaya.ru/stud/the.global.airline.industry.pdf)
5. [Airport Engineering: Planning, Design, and Development of 21st century airports, by Norman J. Ashford](http://books.ms/main/4917C01E21090B239567A7EC91348B4B)

## 2. Research Papers

1. [A Survey on Reinforcement Learning in Aviation Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02147): November 2022.

## 3. Interesting Links

1. [AGIFORS](https://agifors.org/): A crazy society of people who are into Operations Research and the Aviation Industry. The society has researchers from all over the world, universities and industry, and has produced ground-breaking research. One may join it as a Correspondent (it is free of cost) and can get access to all the great work they do.
2. [Airline Management: MIT OCW Course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/16-75j-airline-management-spring-2006/): A neat course on Airline Management by Prof. Peter Belobaba. I refered to parts of the courses while reading the above books, found it useful at places. Covers all aspects of Airline Management, but has concise slides and a few readings. I think one can gain more from this course if pursued along with reading the book written by Prof. Belobaba (The Global Airline Industry).
3. [INFORMS](https://www.informs.org/): Well, INFORMS is a society by researchers into Operations Research and Decision Sciences. From what I have seen, the Transportation Science part of it has a lot of stuff on Aviation (mostly route scheduling and so on).
