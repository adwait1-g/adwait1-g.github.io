title: Resources on Transportation and Logistics
---

Off-late (10 March 2025), I have been reading about and working on the concept of Physical Internet. It is an alternate paradigm of logistics network inspired from the Digital Internet. As part of that, I come across lot of interesting books, papers, articles etc., on PI and related stuff. I will be putting all of them here.

# 1. PI related papers and literature

## 1.1 General

1. [Towards a Physical Internet: Meeting the Global Logistics Sustainability Grand Challenge](https://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/2494032): White paper by Prof. Benoit Montreuil that formalized the concept of Physical Internet.

## 1.2 Routing and Transportation

# 2. Transportation Networks (Theory, Engineering)

1. [Transportation Network Analysis by Prof. Stephen D. Boyles](https://sboyles.github.io/book.pdf): Currently reading this one (10 March 2025)
2. [The Vehicle Routing Problem](https://industri.fatek.unpatti.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/002-The-Vehicle-Routing-Problem-Monograf-on-discrete-mathematics-and-applications-Paolo-Toth-Daniele-Vigo-Edisi-1-2002.pdf)
3. [Logistics Transportation Systems by MD Harder](https://ftp.idu.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/ebook/ip/LOGISTIK%20TRANSPOTASI/Logistics%20Transportation%20Systems%20by%20MD%20Sarder%20(z-lib.org).pdf)
