Even though there is a dedicated page for transportation and logistics, I am putting them here
because I want them along with PI because they are highly relevant for PI research.

## 1. PI related papers and literature

# 1.1 Architecture and Frameworks

First and foremost, checkout the proceedings of all the International Physical Internet Conferences (IPIC) so far - that should inform possible latest developments in PI. For example, you get the entire IPIC 2024 proceedings [here](https://ipic2024.pi.events/). Apart from that, there are a number of high-value publications in journals and other conferences. Adding to that, I came across a number of Masters' thesis on PI. I will be listing them as well.
