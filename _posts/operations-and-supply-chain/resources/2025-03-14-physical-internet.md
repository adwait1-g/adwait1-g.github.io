Even though there is a dedicated page for transportation and logistics, I am putting them here
because I want them along with PI because they are highly relevant for PI research.

## 1. PI related papers and literature

# 1.1 General

1. [Towards a Physical Internet: Meeting the Global Logistics Sustainability Grand Challenge](https://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/2494032): White paper by Prof. Benoit Montreuil that formalized the concept of Physical Internet.

# 1.2 Routing and Transportation

## 4. Logistics

# 4.1 Books

1. [Operations Management, by Russel and Taylor](http://jtelen.free.fr/0MARINE%20bouquins/%5BRoberta_S._Russell,_Bernard_W._Taylor%5D_Operations(Bookos.org).pdf): My first book on Operations Management, an excellent introductory book. Gives a taste of the various facets of Operations (Inventory, Facility Location, Facility Design, Resource Planning, Supply Chain Management and so on).
2. [Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning and Operation by Chopra and Meindl](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abdelkader-Bouaziz/post/Can_I_request_if_someone_can_help_me_with_pearson_instructor_manual_for_Supply_chain_management_strategy_planning_and_operation_2016/attachment/5f09e009ceab7c0001366546/AS%253A912140693143553%25401594482696611/download/Supply%2BChain%2BManagement%2BStrategy%252C%2BPlanning%252C%2Band%2BOperation.pdf): A detailed introduction to Supply Chain management and logistics. This is the book my Operations professor recommended when I asked him what I had to do in order to deep dive.
3. [DHL: From Startup to Global Upstart](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/DHL-Startup-Upstart-Po-Chung/dp/1501515926): DHL is a well-known logistics company and this book is about its story. DHL is a California based start-up which is acquired by Deutsche Post in the early 2000s, then it goes on to become the world leader in logistics service. Its not really a technical book, but if one is fascinated by Logistics, they might end up liking it. Book is available on libgen.

# 4.2 Research Papers
