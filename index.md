Hello there!

I am Adwaith, welcome to my space. I am a first year management student currently studying at ESCP Business School in Berlin. I am broadly into Information Systems and Operations Management, along with mathematical modelling and optimization. I wrote about niche cybersecurity stuff earlier, you can find them [here](/archive/). You can find more about me [here](/about-me/).

## 2. Interest Areas

I am in the exploration phase, and interested in multiple areas.

1. Information Systems and Enterprise Resource Planning
2. Operations Management (Inventory Management, Forecasting, Facility Layout and Design, Location Planning and so on)
3. Supply Chain Management and Logistics
4. Operations Research
5. Management Sciences
6. Mathematical Modelling
7. Aviation Management and Airport Operations
8. Energy and Petroleum Industry
9. Machine Learning and its application to Business problems

Add to that - anything new seems interesting to me.

I am currently exploring two topics/research areas in particular:

1. Inventory Management: I started with the basic EOQ model and attempting to understand more sophisticated models and problems in inventory management. I recently read a bunch of papers on Zara's demand forecasting, inventory management and clearance sale pricing. [Prof. Felipe Caro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0y4F90EAAAAJ&hl=en) is the first author of most of the papers on Zara's systems. They not only published in detail about these systems but also a paper on how decision makers/managers interact with these systems (how much do they adhere to the automated system's decisions and how much do they deviate), that was an interesting [read](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4262830). These are the type of papers I try to read and make sense of - identifying a real business problem, mathematically modelling the system/problem and finding a solution and applying it back to the real world and see how it performs - this is exactly the kind of stuff I am interested in.     
2. Physical Internet: This is a concept that aims to build an Internet-like supply-chain system. The idea of PI is quite interesting where a sustainable supply-chain system is built anologous to the Digital Internet/DI. The physical packages in supply-chains are equivalent to the internet packets. Prof. Benoit Montreuil from Georgia Tech is leading this initiative and research area, and its been about 15 years the idea was formalized in the form of a [white paper](https://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/2494032). Quite a bit of research has been done, a lot is left between conceptualization and actual implementation and commercialization of this concept - this is what I am interested in. It is this beautiful combination of transportation, mobility, network design problems which is taking inspiration from the digital internet but has its own nuances and differences.

Apart from these, the aviation and energy industries fascinate me, especially given how uncertain their business environments are.

I intend to write about all these things here in near future.

Well, if you find any of these or some of the archived stuff interesting, then you might want to keep an eye on this space.

Cheers,
