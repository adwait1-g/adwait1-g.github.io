Hello there!

I am Adwaith, welcome to my space. I am a first year management student currently studying at ESCP Business School in Berlin.

## 1. What interests me?

Any aspect of a firm's operations is of interest to me. To be a bit more specific, the following are the fields I am exploring.

1. Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and its applications in solving Operations and Logistics problems.   
2. Information Systems, IT Management and Strategy, Cyber-Risk Management, Cybersecurity in Finance. Previously, I wrote quite a bit on cybersecurity, [take a look](/cybersecurity/) if it interests you.
3. Operations and Logistics Management
4. Management Science and Operations Research

Along with that, I find the Aviation & Airport Industry, and the Energy Industry very interesting. I do some light reading on these.

I intend to write about these in near future.
